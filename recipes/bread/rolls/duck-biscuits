Duck Tiddy Bacon Biscuits

Ingredients:

	•	2 cups all-purpose flour (plus extra for dusting)
	•	1 tbsp baking powder
	•	1/2 tsp salt
	•	1/4 cup cold butter, cubed (6 tablespoons total after adjustments)
	•	1/4 cup rendered duck fat, cold (minus 1/2 tablespoon)
	•	1/2 cup whole milk
	•	2 tbsp heavy cream (plus a little extra for brushing)
	•	300g smoked duck breast, diced
	•	1/4 cup Point Reyes blue cheese, crumbled
	•	Optional: Fresh thyme or rosemary (1/4 tsp) for a bit of herby flavor

Directions:

	1.	Preheat the Oven: Set it to 425°F (220°C) and line a baking sheet with parchment paper or foil.
	2.	Prep the Duck: Dice the smoked duck breast. In a hot wok or skillet, add a teaspoon of rendered duck fat and toss in the duck pieces. Sauté until they’re crispy and golden around the edges, about 2-3 minutes. Remove from heat and let them cool on a paper towel.
	3.	Mix Dry Ingredients: In a large mixing bowl, whisk together 2 cups of flour, 1 tablespoon of baking powder, and 1/2 teaspoon of salt.
	4.	Cut in the Fats: Add the cold butter cubes and cold duck fat to the flour mixture. Use a pastry cutter or your fingers to cut the fats into the flour until it forms coarse crumbs. Aim for pea-sized bits of butter that’ll make the biscuits flaky.
	5.	Add the Liquid: Pour in 1/2 cup of whole milk and 2 tablespoons of heavy cream. Gently mix until the dough just starts to come together. If it feels dry, add a little more milk (a tablespoon at a time) until it holds together.
	6.	Adjust with Flour as Needed: If the dough is too wet and sticky, add a tablespoon or two of flour until you can shape it into a ball.
	7.	Fold in the Duck & Cheese: Add the crispy duck pieces and 1/4 cup of blue cheese. Gently fold them into the dough, being careful not to overmix.
	8.	Shape the Dough: Turn the dough out onto a floured surface. Pat it down to about 1-inch thickness. Use a 2.5 to 3-inch biscuit cutter to cut out rounds. Gently press together scraps and cut out more biscuits as needed.
	9.	Bake: Place the biscuits on the prepared baking sheet. Brush the tops with a little extra cream for a golden finish. Bake for 12-15 minutes, until the tops are golden brown and the bottoms are firm.
	10.	Check for Doneness: Lift a biscuit to check for a golden bottom and carefully split one to ensure it’s fluffy and fully cooked inside.
	11.	Serve Warm: Let them cool for a couple of minutes and dig in while they’re warm, soft, and mouthwateringly perfect.

There you go! This should get anyone hooked on the magic of Duck Tiddy Bacon Biscuits.
