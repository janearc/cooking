pizza rolls
---
Timeless coffee in Piedmont makes rolls that are basically folded space and I don't know how they are done. So rather than try to figure out how they do that geometrically, I just made rolls the way you would make cinnamon rolls and filled them with cheese and tomato paste.

Ingredients
---
- one ounce fresh basil
- 2 6-ounce (170g) cans tomato paste (I used Muir Glen)
- Daiya or other shredded mozarella cheese (I used Parmela, was unimpressed)
- salt, pepper to taste
- (optional) protein such as Tofurky pepperoni product

Begin with **bread starter**. Don't worry about seasoning it. Let it rise. As it's rising, de-stem the basil and chop it roughly. Combine the basil and the tomato paste with salt and pepper.

Preheat the oven to 350Â°F.

Roll the bread out on a floured surface, and apply olive oil to the inside, along with tomato paste mixture, liberal cheese (about 1/2 the bag, 100g), and then roll the whole thing up.

Cut into 1"-1.5" sections and place into oiled (olive oil works well) stoneware pan in the oven. Oil the top of the rolls, and put bits of tomato paste as well as additional cheese on top. Remove at 30 minutes, add more olive oil, and replace for another 10 minutes, at which point it is done.

Let cool and serve.
