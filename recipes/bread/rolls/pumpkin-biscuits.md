pumpkin biscuits
---
This recipe is adapted from Joy of Cooking's sweet potato biscuit recipe. In this context, "biscuit" refers to the American English definition of biscuit, generally meaning what in UK English would be called a "scone".

Ingredients:
- 3/4 c **pumpkin pulp**
- 1/4 c melted butter
- 2/3 c whole fat coconut milk
- 1.75 c flour
- 2.75t baking powder
- 1T sugar
- 1t salt

Beat together the pumpkin, butter, and coconut milk until it develops a uniform texture in a large bowl.

In a separate bowl, sift together the flour, baking powder, salt, and sugar.

Pre-heat oven to 450Â°F.

Stir together flour and the pumpkin mixture until a dough forms, and turn onto a floured silicone mat and toss lightly. Continue to add flour while turning the dough. When it no longer adheres to the mat or your hands, roll out into a 1/4" biscuit roll and cut into approximately twenty-four biscuits.

Cook for fifteen minutes on a greased (use coconut oil) cookie sheet for approximately fifteen minutes.
