bao and pandesal
---
through an accident of childhood and marriage i have had both [pandesal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pandesal) and [bao](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baozi) in my home throughout most of my life. both of these rolls require egg, nominally. as texture goes, they're a sweet bread (not sweetbread) that is sticky and hearty and is usually used as a substrate for other things (like char siu) and is often served with dim sum but really is just a staple of [all-the-meals](http://www.quickmeme.com/All-The-Things/). or, at least, this is the way it has been in my life (*herein lies my cultural disclaimer as a person who is not filipino or chinese:* i do not speak with authority on this subject).

this recipe is not authentic for either bao or pandesal as it lacks egg but it is a sweet roll that is flexible enough for both and is relatively easy to make.

it is based upon the recipe at [astig vegan](http://www.astigvegan.com/vegan-pandesal/).

ingredients:
- 1 packet yeast
- 3 T shortening
- 1.25c vanilla almond milk
- 3 c flour
- .5 c sugar
- 1 T flaxseed meal
- .5 t baking powder
- 1 t salt
- bread crumbs (you probably have a stale loaf of bread sitting around, right? and a zester?) *optional*
- earth balance butter

in a small bowl, combine yeast, one tablespoon of sugar, almond milk, and shortening. the shortening should be room temperature and the almond milk should be the temperature of warm bathwater (not scalding; if you need an actual temperature, nothing more than 110Â°F). set this aside after thoroughly mixing the sugar and yeast.

in a larger bowl, whisk together the flaxseed meal, baking powder, sugar, flour, and salt. when this seems mixed, and the yeast has risen (and ten minutes or so has elapsed), combine the yeast and the flour with a spatula. stir this a bit until a sticky dough forms.

once a dough coalesces, take this out of the larger bowl, and turn this by hand with additional flour on a silicone mat, adding flour and kneading until it is no longer sticky. this will take a little time and effort. leave it to rise, covered, for an hour, somewhere warm.

in an hour, come back and form it into rolls on parchment paper, and cover the whole enterprise. wherever you found to let it rise before that was warm is probably the best place to leave it to rise again for an hour.

apply a light wash of earth balance butter to the top of the rolls with a silicone brush and put a little bit of bread crumbs and finely crushed flake salt if you wish to make pandesal-like rolls.
