bread
---
I admit to having read all of Tony Bourdain's books before he became "a writer" and was more of a chef who wrote. He spoke of the way bread was made with great mystery. In *[Kitchen Confidential](https://smile.amazon.com/Kitchen-Confidential-Updated-Adventures-Underbelly/dp/0060899220/)* in particular, there is an anecdote of *the one and only person* who knew how to make the bread *just right* for Les Halles in NY (there wasn't a Les Halles in DC at the time), and that, while he (Bourdain) was competent as a chef and cook (and had an education to go with it!) still kind of struggled to get it perfect or to understand how to make it work exactly. If the person who tended to the bread did not come in to work, the restaurant was in trouble.

When I talk to other cooks about getting bread right, the world seems to be divided into two camps: those that seem to "get" bread, and those who do not.

What I would like to do is break down that wall a little bit. I have myself vacillated a little between understanding bread and getting it to do my bidding (even going so far as raising the temperature in my entire kitchen to 80°F in the hopes that the yeast would "take" in my bread starter), completely punting on the subject and refusing to even try to make bread, and more recently having come to accept that bread is merely chemistry (& biology, sometimes!) that happens when you pay attention and Do The Right Stuff™, in The Right Order™, and sometimes Luck™ is involved.

As person who is vegan, you are going to run into a couple problems. Primarily, you do not have access to eggs, which are used in many breads (like challah), and butter is used in nearly everything. This latter part is easily overcome with modern products like Earth Balance or even the simple I Can't Believe It's Not Butter and the fancier, more exotic, harder-to-find, Miyoko's cultured butter product.

So I want to point out some resources for aspiring breadmakers.

- [King Arthur](https://www.kingarthurflour.com/), which makes terrific flour, also has a great [primer](https://www.kingarthurflour.com/tips/quick-bread-primer.html) on leavening agents (that is, things that make bread rise). There's a lot on that site just in general.
- [minimalist baker](minimalistbaker), Dana, has done a lot of work making bread recipes, such as [a super easy whole grain seeded bread](http://minimalistbaker.com/the-easiest-whole-grain-seeded-bread/).

general rules of thumb

- for lifting flour with baking powder, you need 1 tsp of powder for each cup of flour. you'll need more for additional ingredients like fruit (or pumpkin...).
- sourdough requires a [starter](http://www.kingarthurflour.com/recipes/sourdough-starter-recipe)
- yeast can lift seemingly anything (I've yet to run into anything that a single packet of yeast can't lift)
