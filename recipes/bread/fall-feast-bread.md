the fall feast bread
---
This bread began as a research project between Doe, Kara, and Jane; this was the first time Jane had made a vegan bread, and the first time they had made a vegan pumpkin anything. It turned out pretty well. Essentially, pumpkin bread is mostly "banana bread" only with pumpkin instead of banana. It should seem familiar if you've made banana bread.

The bread eats like a meal; it is moist and heavy (think pound cake) and is probably best served toasted with butter and possibly syrup. It is not overly sweet.

Ingredients:

Combine in a saucepan over low heat, stirring to create a sort of custard:
- 2/3 cup maple syrup
- 1 can whole-fat coconut milk
- 1.5 tsp ginger
- 1.5 tsp cinnamon
- 1 tsp allspice
- .5 tsp clove
- 4 T flaxseed meal (stiffener)
- 4 T bourbon
- 2 cups **pumpkin** pulp as described elsewhere in this repository

Place in a large bowl separately:
- 2.5 c flour
- .75 tsp baking soda
- 5 tsp baking powder

Fold the custard into the flour.

When dough forms, fold into dough:
- 1/4 c dried fruit (tart cherries or cranberries)

Place dough in a bread pan and sprinkle on top:
- 1/4 c dark or semisweet chocolate, minced
- salt flakes to taste

Bake for 65 minutes at 350Â°F in a lightly oiled non-stick pan.
