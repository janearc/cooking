# Tools

* loaf pan, 10x5.5x2.5", stoneware
* stand mixer (dough hook, paddle)
* something to make a warm water bath (two bowls is fine)


# Ingredients

* Flour: 3-3.5c all purpose flour (i've been using king arthur)
* Active Dry Yeast: 33ml (i've been using bob's red mill)
* Milk: .75 cup
* Eggs: 4 large
* Butter: 1 cup 
* Salt: 1 teaspoon
* Sugar: 3 tablespoons

# Prep

Start with all ingredients room temperature. Create a warm water bath (warm to the touch, not hot/scalding). Roughly cut butter into cubes. Take a small amount of butter (~1T) and melt in the loaf pan just to prevent adhesion when baking. Too much and you'll get a weird burny crust which sounds great but actually isn't.

# Directions

Place milk, sugar, and yeast in the smaller bowl in the warm water bath. Whisk lightly. 

Using the paddle, combine eggs and sugar in the stand mixer until roughly mixed. They won't come together on their own. Add flour one cup at a time, slowly, waiting for dough to become sticky and pull together. It will probably be time for the dough hook at the third cup.

After switching to the dough hook, start slowly adding flour, 1/8 cup at a time, or just eyeball it. The idea is to get a cohesive dough that the hook can work. It's going to be sticky and wet, but you want to let it be sticky and wet. Continue to run the dough hook, and you will start to see the dough get shiny and stretchy. As this happens, you might possibly need more flour, but be sparing.

You want to run the dough hook for maybe even 7-8 minutes. The thing you're looking for is window paning.

When you've got the dough looking right, it should just come out of the bowl easily. Form it into a rough loaf shape in your hand but take care to not fold the dough or it will bake into weird shapes. Place the loaf into the pan.

Let the dough rise for 2.5 hours.

Whenever you feel like it, set the oven to 425F. Personally I like having the oven warm when I am proofing the dough, but this is probably not your preference. 

# Baking

You are going to bake this for 20-25 minutes, but you probably want to eyeball this. You can also use a temperature probe and wait for your bread to be 170-180F internally. It should just fall out of the pan you baked it in, so have a wire cooling rack ready when you pull it out.
