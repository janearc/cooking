rainy day whole wheat
---
i made whole wheat bread because i wanted something hearty on a day that oakland had been getting inundated with a storm that had lasted something like a week. the recipe is mostly verbatim from [king arthur's](http://www.kingarthurflour.com/recipes/classic-100-whole-wheat-bread-recipe), adjusted for taste and to remove dairy.

ingredients:
- 1 c warm water
- .25 c almond milk
- .25 c shortening
- .25 c molasses
- 3.5 c whole wheat flour
- 1 packet yeast
- 1.25 t salt
- 1 T sugar

in a large bowl, whisk together warm (100°F or so) water, almond milk, shortening, molasses, yeast, salt, and sugar. when this is uniform, fold in the flour; it should come together into a neat, taut dough. knead for ten minutes and leave to rise for as much as two hours.

when the dough is risen, form into an eight inch log and place in an 8x4 loaf pan and allow it to rise another two hours.

bake 35-40 minutes at 350°F, tenting with foil at 20 minutes.

when removing from oven, baste crust lightly with butter.
