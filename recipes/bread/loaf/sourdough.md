sourdough
---
you'll need sourdough starter. you can either [make this yourself](http://www.kingarthurflour.com/recipes/sourdough-starter-recipe), or you can get it from a friend or [indeed from the internet](http://www.kingarthurflour.com/shop/items/classic-fresh-sourdough-starter-1-oz).

to start:
- 3 cups flour
- 60g sourdough starter
- 1.5 c warm water
- 1T coconut sugar
- 2T salt

start with 60 grams of sourdough starter, taking care to feed your remaining starter and put it back in the fridge.

combine the starter, water, flour, and sugar in a large bowl and stir vigorously. it will be a wet and sticky dough. it's not necessary to "knead" the dough as you would a dough that rises with yeast or baking powder. understand that the starter is the leavening agent so the intention here is to mix the starter with the flour and the water and sugar.

turn this on a counter top using a pulling and stretching motion to create glutinous structures in the dough. it will be quite sticky. you may use water to keep your hands less-sticky if you need to (I keep the faucet running with a drip as I turn the dough for this purpose). while you do this, fold in the salt (as much as you like; it's the only seasoning for this bread and without it, it will be bland). do this until the dough seems to have been thoroughly formed (this takes me about ten minutes), and leave the dough to proof at room temperature (but warm) for four hours covered.

leave the dough to sit in the refrigerator, overnight.

the following day, take the dough out -- it should have risen some, possibly not a lot. it will still be sticky/tacky to the touch. you will need to add another 2-ish cups of flour. you can use any flour; white flour will rise the best, but whole wheat or rye flour will give better texture or taste. work this flour into the dough, forming a neat ball. do this by tucking the outer sides of the dough under it repeatedly and leaving it unbroken on top.

leave this in a bowl to rise for at least four hours at room temperature. i leave this in the sun or somewhere i know will be warm. you can let this rise all day, and if you don't get around to baking it, you can park it in the fridge overnight and let it rise again.

when you're ready to bake, place the risen dough ball in a cast iron dutch oven for twenty minutes at 500°F. you will need to score some slits in the top of it with a razor or equally-sharp knife  after twenty minutes, remove the lid, and cook for another 20-25 minutes at 350°F.

then you need to remove it and let it cool for a couple hours. if you cut it too soon, the bread won't be set, so you need to be patient. you should be rewarded with a wicked crust and a bread suitable for toasting.
