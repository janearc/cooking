hot pockets
---
Hot pockets, if we're honest, are pretty terrible. We like them because they are convenient, not because the food in them is so delicious. We like being able to push a button and have a food come out of the microwave in two minutes.

If what you're looking for is a two-minute vegan hot pocket recipe, this is not the recipe for you.

This recipe can get that time down to about ten minutes, with a varying amount of preparation time (I can make twelve in about ninety minutes, which then require about thirty minutes of par-baking, which then only requires ten minutes of heating, when I make everything from scratch).

Equipment
---
- silicone brush
- silicone pastry mat
- pastry cutter

Ingredients
---
- a filling (broccoli or soyrizo are both available in this repository)
- flaky pastry dough
- butter-alike to glaze
- chilled water

Freeze the pastry dough overnight. Roll it out to about 10x15" on a silicone pastry mat. Cut it across the middle with a pastry cutter, and then section it into six 5x5" squares.

Place a generous serving of the filling (4-6 tablespoons is fine, more may work) on half the squares.

Using the silicone brush, wet the outer edges of each square. With a spatula, lift each of the empty squares (you can do this by lifting a corner and picking it up carefully with your finger if it is still cold enough) and place atop the filled squares. Use a fork to tamp down the top square onto the bottom square and commingle the dough.

When the two pieces of dough are mated, slice a few thin openings in the upper square to give some ventilation for the filling which will expand and settle some during cooking.

Place in refrigerator or freezer for at least one half hour before cooking.

Preparation

**Baking**
If you wish to simply bake and serve these (they are yummy straight out of the oven), bake at 375°F for 35 minutes. Apply butter-alike to the top of each of them at 35 minutes, place back in oven, and cook another 5 minutes (total, 40 minutes), and serve immediately.

**Parbaking**
Parbaking is the process of partially baking something and rapidly ending the cooking process so that it may be frozen and cooked later and stored in a way that is sterile (such that it does not spoil) -- like hot pockets.

There is no yeast in this recipe, and there is no animal fat, so parbaking is a bit of a misnomer.

To parbake this recipe, you would bake at 375°F for 30 minutes, and remove immediately. You would want to have an ice sheet or cold pack nearby (Target sells things like this for about $2.99). This allows you to cool the item very rapidly so that it can be placed in the freezer without spoilage and condensation.

Give it a couple minutes to cool, and then freeze it wrapped in cling-wrap, more or less indefinitely. When you wish to bake it the rest of the way, heat it at 375°F for 10 more minutes. It should "reheat" just fine. You may glaze with butter-alike as above.
