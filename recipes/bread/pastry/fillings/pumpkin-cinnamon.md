pumpkin cinnamon filling
---
This is the same filling I use for the pumpkin cinnamon rolls elsewhere in this repository.

Combine in a saucepan:
- 1c pumpkin pulp
- 2T bourbon
- 4T granulated sugar
- 2T maple syrup
- 1/8 tsp cinnamon
- 1/8 tsp ginger
- 1/8 tsp allspice
- 1T butter (earth balance)

it's fairly stiff and is suitable for rolls & fillings.
