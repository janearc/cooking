pumpkin cinnamon filling
---
This is the same filling I use for the pumpkin cinnamon rolls elsewhere in this repository.

Combine in a saucepan (or without heat, it is easier to do with low heat, but can be done in a bowl by hand):
- 1c pumpkin pulp
- 2T bourbon
- 4T granulated sugar
- 2T maple syrup
- 1/8 tsp cinnamon
- 1/8 tsp ginger
- 1/8 tsp allspice
- 1T butter (earth balance)

it's fairly stiff and is suitable for rolls & fillings.
