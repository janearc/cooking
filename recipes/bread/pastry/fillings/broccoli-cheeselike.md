broccoli cheeselike filling
---
In savoury pastries, it is common to see both broccoli and cauliflower paired with cheese, in particular cheddar. Of course, cheese is a complicated concept in vegan recipes, with many approaches. This approach uses nutritional yeast.

ingredients:
- 6T nutritional yeast
- 3T corn starch
- 1t salt
- .5 c plain almond milk
- .5 c water
- 1T vegetable oil (possibly olive oil)
- one spring onion, thinly sliced
- 2T fresh parsely, finely minced

combine yeast, starch, salt, almond milk, and vegetable oil in a saucepan on low-medium heat, stirring continually with a spatula (a whisk will not get to all the corners where the corn starch and yeast will clump). When this thickens, add water, spring onion, parsely, stir to uniformity (the water will break the sauce), and remove to lowest heat, stirring continually until it comes back into solution.

- 1lb broccoli, minced very finely
- 2 medium-sized shallots
- 2tsp salt

filling

Combine the minced vegetable mixture into the saucepan when the sauce is ready. Place in refrigerator to cool immediately, and use only when cooled in pastry (heated it will cause the butter/shortening to perspire from the dough).
