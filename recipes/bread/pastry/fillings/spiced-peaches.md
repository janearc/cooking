spiced peaches with rum
---
this is my rough recollection of what went into it; it was pretty tasty, if kind of runny, so it may not be suitable for something that requires a stiff filling.

- 1 t cinnamon
- .5 t clove
- 3 T rum (I used Kraken overproof rum; this was a mistake. use any dark, spiced rum)
- 3 T maple syrup
- 2 T butter (earth balance in this case)
- 1 T granulated sugar

I froze two softball-sized peaches that were very ripe, and defrosted them on a plate on the counter. When they started falling apart, I pulled their skins off with my fingers, and picked their pits out and put them in compost. I put the flesh in a saucepan on low heat and added the above ingredients, stirring slowly. It creates a very "spiced peaches, like you remember" taste, if that's something you remember (I was missing McCutcheon's spiced peaches).
