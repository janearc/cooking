savoury pumpkin filling
---
Pumpkin is just a vegetable and is by no means required to always be served sweet. This is a filling for e.g., [pasties](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pasty).

- 4T **pumpkin pulp**
- 2T minced pecans
- 1/4 tsp salt
- pinch coriander
- black pepper to taste

Can be used with **flaky dough** to make 2-4 pasties. Savoury pasties are a lovely complement to **cannabis carriers** if you are so inclined and live in a progressive legislative environment.
