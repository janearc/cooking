persimmon apple filling
---
ingredients:
- 3 haychia persimmons
- 1 fuji apple
- 2T cointreau
- zest of one lemon

remove the stem from the persimmons, and peel them. the persimmons should be so ripe that they are basically falling apart and peeling them should be easily accomplished with your fingers and a paring knife. quartering the persimmons should make this work easier, and make removing the white, bitter parts from the middle of the fruit easier. also, waiting until the fruit is very ripe -- nearly "bruised" in ripeness -- will obviate the bitterness that some persimmons can have.

when all the persimmons are peeled and collected in a bowl, macerate to a pulp with a fork, optionally using a knife if required.

add the cointreau and lemon zest.

mince the apple very finely and stir into the persimmon mixture. this filling is a very wet filling and may not be suitable for e.g., pop tarts without being strained (you may use a tea filter/strainer or cheese cloth for this but you will lose some of the "persimmony" flavour).
