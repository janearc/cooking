soyrizo daiya filling
---
- one package soyrizo
- 1/4 c finely minced parsely, de-stemmed
- 1/2 c chopped scallions
- 1/2 c Daiya cheddar shreds
- 1-2 finely minced fresno chiles or jalapeños

Combine with a spatula. This would be used with e.g., **flaky dough** to make something like "hot pockets" type *par-baked* pre-cooked meals.

All the ingredients are safe to eat, but Daiya needs about 20 minutes at 350°F to properly melt.

The consistency you are looking for from the above is something you could squeeze through a tube, so *finely minced* means pretty darn finely. If it is not minced finely enough, it won't do well when it is baked.
