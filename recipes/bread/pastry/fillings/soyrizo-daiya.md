soyrizo daiya filling
---
- one package soyrizo
- 1/4 c finely minced parsely, de-stemmed
- 1/2 c chopped scallions
- 1/2 c Daiya cheddar shreds

Combine with a spatula. This would be used with e.g., **flaky dough** to make something like "hot pockets" type *par-baked* pre-cooked meals.

All the ingredients are safe to eat, but Daiya needs about 20 minutes at 350Â°F to properly melt.
