cannabis carriers
---
Cannabis is easy to add to things. Unfortunately most commercially available edible products include either dairy or gelatin. The easiest solution is to buy a CO2 or water extract and cook something yourself. However, because these extracts are very potent, and you're buying by the gram (and generally we measure our edible dosage in miligrams), you need a kitchen scale.

A simple cannabis carrier might be:

- overproof rum (kraken brand or bacardi 151)
- added to any other filling in the pastry fillings repository here

Another approach would be adding the extract to the oil in other recipes found in this repository. The problem is the dosages are going to be less easy to meter. Smaller batches, tighter constraints, and weighed outputs are the benefits of using pastry as a carrier, and in particular of using pastry filling.

Alcohol makes a rather poor solvent as it boils quickly below the decarboxylation temperature, leaving residue in whatever you are cooking/preparing with, so it is better to use an oil like coconut or sesame oil if the recipe permits.

a note on decarboxylation

Almost all the recipes in this repository exceed 250Â°F, which means decarboxylation occurs. This is important, but you do not need to worry about it.
