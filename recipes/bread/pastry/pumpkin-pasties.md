pumpkin insomnia pasties
---
I'd had a bad bout of insomnia and found myself with a surplus of hashish, some pumpkin (not enough to make bread or a pie or anything), a new knowledge of pastry dough, and a need to get to sleep.

I decided to do the only logical thing: make savoury pumpkin turnovers. The recipe I describe here produces triangles and so is not explicitly a pasty (so please don't yell at me UK people, but in the US we don't really have savoury pastries).

ingredients
---
- **savoury pumpkin filling**
- **cannabis carrier** (optional)
- **flaky pastry dough**

After adding the cannabis carrier to the pumpkin filling and mixing thoroughly, I made the usual flaky pastry dough and rolled it out into 8x8" squares. These I cut into triangles, and placed about a tablespoon and a half of the pumpkin filling.

I spread the pumpkin filling with my fingers to cover all but the edges of the pastry dough, and then folded the edges of the dough over, wetting them with a silicone brush and chilled water.

I tamped the edges of the pasties with a fork to keep the pasties together, and I brushed them lightly with olive oil, and sprinkled just a dash of crushed black pepper and coarse flake salt on top.

At this point, they should be placed in the freezer for thirty minutes.

They are placed in a 375Â°F oven for 30 minutes, at which point you should make sure they are done, but usually they need another 5 minutes.

I am pleased to report that my first pasty emerged from the oven at zero four twenty on a night in which I had insomnia, no lie.
