bread starter
---
This is mostly stolen from [minimalist baker](http://minimalistbaker.com), but mostly resembles what I used to use in Joy of Cooking. It's a simple bread starter. Start with:

- 1 packet yeast
- 1 cup almond milk (sweetened is fine; more sugar is good for the yeast)
- 1 tablespoon sugar

Warm the almond milk in the microwave to "warmish" -- Dana describes it as "warm bathwater" and this is about correct. Add the sugar and yeast and dissolve both. Let it sit for a bit (~10 minutes).

You will notice that the yeast is doing its job.

You will need to let the dough rise about 30-60 minutes. I try to do this somewhere warm.

Basically you add about 3 cups of flour in a large mixing bowl, in half-cup-ish increments, stirring, and then turning it on a floured surface. Then you let it rise, mash it down once, turn it, and cook it 30-40 minutes in the oven at 350Â°F. You would add seasonings (such as *pumpkin* and so forth) to the starter while it is a liquid. You can use whole wheat or white flour.

- you can use soy milk instead of almond milk; you'll only need 2.5c flour
