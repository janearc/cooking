summer salad
--
Arugula
Jicama
Strawberry
Cherry tomatoes
Hemp hearts or quinoa for texture/body/nutritional value
Candied walnuts (lightly, and not “spiced”)
Vidalia onion or shallots, sliced paper thin
Avocado

Dice avocado, strawberry, and jicama; set aside.

Dressing: three parts rich balsamic to one part olive oil (something cheap is fine). Sweeten with maple syrup. Add pepper and salt to taste.

Combine arugula with jicama, strawberry, walnuts, and cherry tomatoes. Toss until roughly distributed. Add hemp or quinoa; add dressing, incrementally so as to not create pooling of ingredients. Add avocado & onion. Toss lightly to avoid mushing avocado, serve immediately; sprinkle a touch of coarse salt on each serving.

This is actually lovely the next day, cold from the fridge, but won't keep well for two days.
