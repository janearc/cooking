# Carrot Lady - Osmostatic Wine Recipe

## Overview
An austere, dry, clear, and herbal ferment. Built like a chardonnay that got lost in a root cellar and learned kung fu from beet ghosts. Distinct carrot, beet, galangal, and ginger flavors—meant to age into something genuinely bewildering and refined.

## Ingredients

- **Carrot Juice**: 2 liters (unsweetened, strained)
- **Beets**: ~300g (roasted or raw, depending on intensity preference)
- **Galangal Root**: ~30g, thinly sliced
- **Fresh Ginger**: ~50g, peeled and sliced
- **Sugar**: ~200g granulated (more can be added if semi-sweet desired)
- **Yeast**: 5g Champagne yeast
- **Fermaid O**: 1 tsp
- **D.A.P.**: ½ tsp
- **Pectic Enzyme**: ½ tsp (additional may be added post-primary for clarity)

## Process

1. **Sanitize everything.** (Even your attitude.)
2. Blend ginger and galangal into some of the carrot juice, strain if chunky.
3. Add all juice, roots, and sugar to sanitized 1-gallon fermenter.
4. Add Fermaid O and D.A.P., stir well.
5. Pitch yeast once must is room temp.
6. Add Pectic Enzyme ~12 hours after yeast pitch.
7. Ferment at ~79°F if possible. Bubble started ~2.5h after pitch.
8. Watch for krausen ("biscuits"). Stir if yeast gets stuck on top and must isn't pelagic.
9. Ferment until bone dry. (It *will* go dry. Trust her.)
10. Taste frequently. Expect sharpness and herbal chaos. Age at least 2-4 weeks before judging.
11. Cold crash, rack, and bottle still.
12. Mandatory aging. Improves *dramatically* with time.

## Notes

- ABV estimated ~12–14%.
- Absolutely no back sweetening—intended to confront, not coddle.
- Best enjoyed in a heavy ceramic mug while judging someone's soul.
