pumpkin pie syrupy dessert wine

- blend 350g of ginger in 500g distilled water, strain into fermenter
- blend 1200g of granulated sugar into 1L of carrot juice, add to fermenter
- blend 16oz pumpkin puree into 500ml carrot juice, strain, add to fermenter
- blend together into 1L of carrot juice and add to fermenter:
  - 1 tsp fermaid o
	- .5 tsp DAP
	- .5 tsp pectic enzyme
- fill remainder of 1gal fermenter with distilled water
- add yeast (champagne yeast is a good fit)

this is an extremely high osmolality must. you will need to gently stir it, possibly daily.
it will start very slowly and then take off extremely quickly. for me, this was two very
intense weeks, and then it crashed suddenly with almost no warning.

the "stabilizer" for this brew is actually the osmolality. it will not be carbonated and
should bottle just fine without any expansion. the first thing ensuring this is the very
high osmolality, and the second (you can get to 20% possibly with champagne yeast and this
much sugar) is the ABV. the yeast just cannot survive in this environment.

i cold crashed and freeze distilled this per the directions in the freeze distillation
document in this directory.

i then bottled and crashed and separated again and got 2L very thick, very high abv, syrupy
wine.

if the must stalls mid-way you may need to introduce some oxygenated distilled water,
and you may need to add a little fermaid as well, depending. you may also want to keep
this around 79F. this is a very difficult environment for yeast.
