the first time i ever made wine from grapes

- blend 1200g of granulated sugar into 1L of grape juice, add to fermenter
- blend together and strain through cheesecloth into fermenter, set aside pulp
  - 1lb red grapes
	- 1lb blackberries
	- 1lb pomegranate arils
- blend together into 1L of grape juice and add to fermenter:
  - 1 tsp fermaid o
	- .5 tsp DAP
	- .5 tsp pectic enzyme
- add to fermenter
  - 1T whole black peppercorn
	- 1T whole cloves
	- 4 sticks cinnamon
- add yeast (champagne yeast is a good fit)

separate pulp and put in a mason jar, add a small amount of distilled water and
.5t pectic enzyme to the jar. leave this at room temperature overnight. this is
essentially a rehydrated, enzyme-assisted, maceration extraction. 24h later, add
the entirety of this macerated pulp to the must and stir gently.

this is an extremely high osmolality must. you will need to gently stir it, possibly daily.
it will start very slowly and then take off extremely quickly. for me, this was two very
intense weeks, and then it crashed suddenly with almost no warning.

the "stabilizer" for this brew is actually the osmolality. it will not be carbonated and
should bottle just fine without any expansion. the first thing ensuring this is the very
high osmolality, and the second (you can get to 20% possibly with champagne yeast and this
much sugar) is the ABV. the yeast just cannot survive in this environment.

because of the large amount of sediment in this, you will need to cold crash, possibly
for three full days, to ensure everything sinks. then follow the normal freeze distillation
process, and separate and crash again once bottled.

this is a little like port, but because there is such a short period of fermentation,
it's not casked or aged, and there's such a high mass of fruit per unit volume, this
is a much more substantial wine than any port. and the spice completely changes the
character.

if the must stalls mid-way you may need to introduce some oxygenated distilled water,
and you may need to add a little fermaid as well, depending. you may also want to keep
this around 79F. this is a very difficult environment for yeast.
