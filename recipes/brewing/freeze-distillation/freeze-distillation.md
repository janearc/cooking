freeze distillation
===
freeze distillation or "apple jacking" is the process of freezing a must to separate water
from ethanol. essentially, you are using freezing to increase the abv of a liquid. it can 
also remove some of the harsher notes from fermentation, especially if yeast is highly 
stressed due to high abv environments. this is to say, if you brew for high abv, it actually
works out very well to jack the brew to mellow out the taste that comes from stressed yeast.

for me, the best way to do this is to cold crash for two days first. this separates the
solids and lets the sediment settle, compresses the lees, and lets you more effectively pull
the cleaner/clearer fluid out of your fermenter.

then, siphon or just pour your fermenter into a vessel you can freeze. the must in your
new vessel will take a while to freeze depending on the volume and the abv. with the
little fermenters i use, i need about twenty hours for it to freeze to the point that
i can then begin pulling the ice out.

when you've pulled the ice out, you want to try to extract it, but not a lot. what i do
is i just strain it through cheese cloth with my hands.

you can then discard the ice and bottle the liquid that remains from the jack.

this is possibly not legal, but i would not worry about it if you're not selling it.
but be aware that distillation of ethanol is questionably legal and if that is something
that concerns you, maybe just don't do it.
