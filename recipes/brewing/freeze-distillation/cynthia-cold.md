# Recipe Draft Update: Nitro Slush Prototype - "Cynthia's Cold Kiss" (Fortified & Sanitized)

## Target Profile
Silky, ice-cold fortified cider slush, served via nitro stout tap for cascading pour and **absolute microbial annihilation.** ABV target: **35%+, certified yeast genocide zone.** Texture: creamy but crisp. Flavor: bright apple, subtle spice, gentle florals, lingering warmth.

---

## Base Liquid
- 2.5L high-ABV applejack (target 30% ABV after overjacking)
- 1.0L fresh pressed apple cider (unpasteurized if possible, no preservatives — added just before kegging for aroma and softness)
- 500ml distilled water (for texture control and to balance the spirit to cider ratio)
- 150ml glucose syrup (smooths mouthfeel, stabilizes slush texture, adds a whisper of sweetness)
- Optional: 1ml neroli oil dissolved in glycerol for aromatic lift

---

## Body and Texture
- 100ml glycerol (emulsifier, texture enhancer, frost management)
- Optional: 3g xanthan gum (for crazy luxurious mouthfeel, café flex)

---

## Balancing Acids
- 15ml fresh lemon juice (brightens)
- 10ml malic acid solution (reinforces apple tang)
- Tiny pinch of salt (boosts perception of sweetness and rounds the edges)

---

## Fortification Step
- 350ml neutral grain spirit (190 proof Everclear or equivalent, added just before kegging)
- Optional (for flex): swap half the Everclear for **Calvados** to keep it apple-to-the-core

## Pre-Freezing Process
1. Combine all liquids and additives **except cider and neutral spirit** in fermenter or mixing tank.
2. Chill to 0°C and stir until fully blended.
3. Lower temp to -2°C and monitor for slush formation.
4. Once slush forms, stir every 30 minutes to maintain even consistency.
5. Overjack by removing 30-50% of the water/ice fraction. Taste as you go — goal is to hit ~30% ABV before fortification.
6. After overjacking, add the **fresh cider** and the **neutral spirit**. This ensures fresh apple aroma, bright character, and microbial death ray protection.
7. Mix well, check ABV (target 35%), adjust with spirit if needed.

## Nitro Slush Dispense Process
1. Transfer fortified slush into nitro-compatible keg.
2. Pressurize with pure nitrogen (or beer gas for some bubbles).
3. Hold keg at -2°C to -3°C for slush stability.
4. Dispense through stout faucet for cascading pour.
5. Serve in chilled stemmed glass with garnish (orange twist, rosemary sprig, optional cinnamon stick for holiday chaos).

## Safety Notes
- 35%+ ABV = microbial no-go zone. No yeast, bacteria, or human sadness survives.
- Slush is pressure-stable because of the high ethanol, glycerol, and nitrogen blanket.
- Every batch gets a **final ABV check** before kegging. No guesswork. Science.

## Target Vibe
This is **the signature pour** at Café Pupjes. Guests will sit in awe watching the slush cascade down, and they’ll say, “What *is* this?” and you’ll smile and say, “This is Cynthia’s Cold Kiss — and if you kiss her back, she owns you for the night.”
