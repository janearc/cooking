# M7X - Osmostatic Cola Wine (Dry Aromatic Apéritif, Freeze-Distilled)

A black, still, high-proof cola wine built on the bones of Coca-Cola’s 7X flavor base. Infused with eucalyptus, neroli, black pepper, and midnight wheat. Fermented to exhaustion, then freeze-concentrated to ~30% ABV. Cold, dark, and fizzy. Not a soda—an *experience*.

## Fermentation Process

1. Cold-steep midnight wheat in hot water (~70–80°C), strain.
2. Mix steep with sugar and water to 20L total must volume.
3. Add acids, caffeine, 7X tincture, oak chips, pepper, eucalyptus, and nutrients.
4. Pitch yeast; ferment cold (≤18°C) to total dryness (~20% ABV).
5. Cold crash at 0°C or lower for 3–5 days to flocculate yeast and settle haze.

## Freeze Distillation

1. Transfer clear supernatant to sanitized freezer-safe vessels.
2. Freeze solid; invert and allow melt to drip slowly into aging vessel (keg or carboy).
3. Collect **~10L of concentrated wine**; discard remaining ice.
4. Resulting ABV: **~30%**
5. Rack off lees, transfer to aging vessel (preferably stainless keg).

## Conditioning & Serving

- Age minimum **3–6 months** cold in steel.
- Force carbonate in keg to ~2.5–3.0 volumes CO₂.
- Bottle cold, very sweet.

## Notes

- Final product will be syrupy, inky black, herbaceous, spicy, and volatile.
- Caffeine content and ethanol synergy will hit *hard*—this is not for chugging.
- Serve chilled, in small glasses, over ice, or even with soda water.
