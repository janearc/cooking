# Forest Champagne

A lightly fermented, savory, and earthy tonic designed for microdosing with Psilocybe galindoi sclerotia. Each 240ml serving contains approximately 1mg psilocin-equivalent. This recipe makes 5 liters total (approx. 20 servings).

## Ingredients

- 4.5L filtered water  
- 0.5L fresh beet juice  
- 60ml gochujang (fermented Korean chili paste)  
- 2 tbsp light miso paste  
- 30g morels (fresh or rehydrated), thinly sliced  
- 20g fresh turmeric root, grated  
- 15g fresh ginger root, grated  
- 1 cup whole kumquats, crushed (including peel and pulp)  
- 1 tsp raw honey  
- 1 tsp spirulina powder (hydrated into a paste)  
- 10g dried Psilocybe galindoi sclerotia (or ~30g fresh)

## Instructions

1. **Prepare the decoction**  
   In a small saucepan, combine 10g dried sclerotia with 500ml filtered water. Simmer gently at 70–80°C with the lid on for 30 minutes. Remove from heat, strain, and let cool. Reserve the liquid; discard or compost the solids.

2. **Combine ingredients**  
   In a large sanitized fermentation vessel, add the water, beet juice, gochujang, miso, mushrooms, turmeric, ginger, kumquats, honey, and hydrated spirulina. Stir to combine thoroughly.

3. **Add decoction**  
   Once the sclerotia decoction has cooled to below 40°C, add it to the fermentation vessel and mix well.

4. **Inoculate (optional)**  
   For more consistent fermentation, add 1–2 tbsp of live lacto-brine from sauerkraut, kimchi, or another active ferment. This step is optional if using open fermentation.

5. **Ferment**  
   Cover the vessel with an airlock or breathable cloth and allow to ferment at 18–22°C for 3–5 days. Taste daily. The ferment is ready when it’s lightly sour, slightly fizzy, and all ingredients have melded.

6. **Bottle and store**  
   Strain out solids. Bottle the liquid in sanitized bottles with tight-sealing caps. Leave at room temperature for 1–2 days to build slight carbonation, then refrigerate to halt fermentation.
