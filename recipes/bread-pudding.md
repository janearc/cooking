bread pudding
---
*note:* this is still under refinement. ("beta recipe, consume at own risk")

Notes on ingredients:

I use dried cherries for a tart taste and raisins for a sweet taste and it works
pretty well. I like having the fresh fruit (a peach) in with the bread because it gives a little more texture with the bread. I began making this recipe to "dispose of" bread that had gone stale, so using sourdough will work, but it kind of clashes with the sweet taste of the pudding. Whole Foods in California sells a "sour batard," and I've used it. They also sell a "sweet batard" – this works better.

This is a great recipe in that it disposes of things in my kitchen that are going bad or spoiling, and it produces a lot of food that keeps essentially forever in my freezer and bread pudding is popular with just about everyone I have met who is not gluten-intolerant.

pudding
---
- 4 very ripe bananas
- 2 whole cans whole-fat coconut milk
- 1 whole 16oz loaf vegan bread
- 1/2 cup dried fruit
- 1 peach, diced fresh (optional)
- 2 tsp flaxseed meal (stiffener)
- cinnamon to taste
- allspice to taste
- nutmeg to taste
- almond milk
- coconut oil (for the pan)
- 4 tsp vanilla extract
- 4 tbsp maple syrup
- candied walnuts, 1/8-1/4 cup (optional)

- one 9x13 baking pan

If you are using a stoneware pan, heat oven to 375F, if pyrex, 335F.

Bread should be stale (the reason I started working on this recipe is I
didn't want to waste the odds and ends of loaves of bread that had gone stale);
use a serrated knife and cut it into rough bite-size-ish chunks, set aside in
a bowl. Smaller (diced) is better because it allows for better distribution in the pan. Aim for 1cm cubes, but uniformity is not required.

Mash the bananas with a fork (you should have 1.5-2 cups worth, but this is
approximate) and beat them until they are pretty frothy. This should be easier by adding a couple tablespoons of almond milk to each banana (you may cheat by using an immersion blender). This is the binding
ingredient for the pudding. Combine this in a larger bowl with the coconut milk
and continue to beat with a fork, adding cinnamon, nutmeg, allspice, and vanilla extract. Add maple syrup to this, and
continue to stir. Add flaxseed meal. At this point, you should have a pretty simple pudding or custard, and it should resemble other things if you have prepared a custard or pudding before.

Begin adding the bread cubes, diced peach, and dried fruit to the pudding. Stir with a spatula in a large metal or glass mixing bowl (I use a 31cm bowl for a 9x13 pan). Fold the bread in to the pudding, let it sit for a few minutes, stir again, basically letting the bread absorb the pudding. Eventually there shouldn't be much pudding left sitting in the bottom of the bowl, and it should appear as a uniform mass of "puddingy bread."

Grease the pan lightly using coconut oil and your fingers – it should fit pretty neatly into a 9x13 pan.

Add pudding/bread to the pan using a spatula to distribute evenly. Bake for 32 minutes at 375°F for stoneware (335°F for pyrex), take out, and apply the **glaze** described below; replace in oven, and bake an additional 12 minutes at 400°F (360°F for pyrex) to put a nice crust on top. It's a pudding, so it's going to be moist. It will be wibbly-wobbly, but in generally, if you put a knife in and pull it out, it shouldn't come out covered in puddingy stuff (it will have peach on it), kind of like how you check for the doneness of brownies. Because there are no eggs in this, there is no harm in eating it a little under-done, and if you prefer it a little more dry, you can cook it a little longer.

glaze
---

- one large or two medium-sized over-ripe peaches
- bourbon
- maple syrup

I started with a peach that was unexpectedly way riper than useful, cut off undesirable parts, and froze it. When I started cooking the pudding, I placed the peach by itself in a sauce pan and let it warm to room temperature and removed the skin with my fingers in the sink (freezing helped this along).

I began to mush the peach with a silicone spatula into a consistent sauce and added a few tablespoons of bourbon and a small amount of maple syrup. I heated this very slowly, letting the moisture come out of the peach and letting the peach itself be the basis of the glaze rather than the maple syrup or the bourbon. I brought it up to temperature enough so the alcohol cooked off the bourbon and removed it from heat.
