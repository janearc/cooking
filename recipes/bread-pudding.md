bread pudding
---
*note:* this is still under refinement. ("beta recipe, consume at own risk")

- 4 very ripe bananas
- 2 whole cans whole-fat coconut milk
- 1 whole 16oz loaf vegan bread ("sour batard" from whole foods is fine)
- 1/2 cup dried fruit
- cinnamon to taste
- 4 tsp vanilla extract
- 4 tbsp maple syrup
- candied walnuts, 1/8-1/4 cup

If you are using a stoneware pan, heat oven to 365F, if pyrex, 325F.

Bread should be stale (the reason I started working on this recipe is I
didn't want to waste the odds and ends of loaves of bread that had gone stale);
use a serrated knife and cut it into rough bite-size-ish chunks, set aside in
a bowl.

Mash the bananas with a fork (you should have 1.5-2 cups worth, but this is
approximate) and beat them until they are pretty frothy. This is the binding
ingredient for the pudding. Combine this in a larger bowl with the coconut milk
and continue to beat with a fork, adding cinnamon and vanilla extract. Cinnamon
is approximate, probably 1/8 tsp is appropriate. Add maple syrup to this, and
continue to stir, making sure it does not separate.

I used dried cherries for a tart taste and raisins for a sweet taste and it worked
pretty well. I had sourdough bread and I have mixed feelings on using sourdough
in bread pudding – I think generally it's a poor choice, but you should be able
to overcome the sour-ness of the bread by soaking it in the banana/coconut mixture.

At this point, begin adding the bread to the pan; I used a 9x8 stoneware pan.
Depending on how big your chunks are, you may be able to get them more or less evenly
settled into your pan. Make sure your banana/coconut milk mixture is not separated,
and pour it over the bread. Let it soak for as much as half an hour, making sure to
get the bread saturated, and make sure that all the pieces are in contact with the
mixture. Add the fruit and the candied walnuts to the bread during this process, 
tucking bits and pieces into the hollows; the milk will hydrate the dried fruit and
sweeten them.

Before you put the pudding in the oven, drizzle maple syrup on the top of it fairly
liberally; this will give it a little bit of a glaze, and sweeten it a bit.

It's a little tricky to know when it is "done." There are no eggs in this, so there's
no harm in eating it "before it is done," but basically you are looking to see that the
bananas are cooked, and there is a nice crust on top. For me, this was about 35 minutes
at 365; it was firm and springy to the touch with a fork.

notes
---
I am going to approach the next iteration of this with an actual glaze to apply on top
of it using bourbon and probably molasses. I was originally considering adding pumpkin or
sweet potato to the pudding, but I think instead I am going to add peach slices to it.
The bread chunks are great, but it needs something to break up the texture a bit. I will
update this recipe the next time I make it. I'll also be adding allspice and fresh-grated
nutmeg.
