what's engastration
---
briefly, engastration is the process of cooking (an animal) in its abdominal cavity. that's gross. we don't do that because we like animals. however, it's a great way to cook vegetables. squashes, gourds, and so on, are seasonal and show up in the fall but are generally available throughout the year. i have a few recipes i use to stuff squashes and it's a great way to make a lot of food (semi-) quickly.

principles
---
i leave a squash on my counter in the fall and when i know i will need a meal during the week and i have some time, i prepare it ahead of time and park it in the fridge, so that i can just throw it in the oven when i want it, tv-dinner style (only it takes two hours to cook instead of thirty minutes).

for this i have been really pleased with kabocha squashes, in particular the red kabochas, but i've also used pumpkins, and i think acorn squash would work, as well as butternut squash.

how to prepare:

- cut the top off the squash as described elsewhere in this repository (such as in **squashgiving**)
- remove and compost the seeds and pulp or if you have time, clean the seeds and roast (as explained in the **pumpkin** directory in this repository) for snacks
- prepare the filling in a skillet, as it needs to be cooked before going into the squash
- remove from heat, let cool, and stuff the squash
- let the squash cool a little bit, and place in the fridge
- if possible, let the squash rise to room temperature before cooking the day you intend to eat it
- bake the squash with its filling at 350Â°F for two hours (it takes a while to cook all the way to the centre
- scoop out filling with the meat from the squash and serve as one dish; compost the husk/rind

i generally get about 2.5 meals worth of food, depending on the size of the squash and how hungry i am. for more than two people you may want to use two squashes.
