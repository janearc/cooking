basic squash filling
---
- 1 cup minced celery
- 2 cups minced red potatoes
- 1 cup minced red onion
- 1 cup minced green onion ("spring onions")
- 1/2 cup minced shallot
- 2T minced/shredded fresh sage
- 2 cups daiya mozzarella
- 1 package uptons italian seitan

sautee the potatoes in coconut oil until browning starts, seasoning with coarse salt and pepper. add to this the celery, red onion, shallot, and seitan, and add more coconut oil as this will dry out. as this browns and begins to cook, monitor your potatoes for doneness; once they start looking done, add the sage and green onion, turning frequently in the pan (the sage is delicate and you want to season with it, not burn it). when everything looks and smells pretty happy, remove from heat, add the daiya and turn so that it spreads evenly throughout the filling. make sure it cools and doesn't burn the cheese on the pan. when it's cooled a bit, you can start putting it in the squash.

tomatoey squash filling
---
- 1 package beyond beef crumbles
- 2 cups de cecco fusili
- 1 cup minced red onion
- 2 medium tomatoes, cut into eighths
- 2T minced/shredded fresh sage
- 1 pint tomato sauce (i seem to use "dave's gourmet" a lot?)

brown the beef in coconut oil with the onion in a skillet, seasoning with oregano, thyme, and rosemary to taste (or whatever works for you). while this is happening, cook the pasta and drain, setting it aside. when the beef is browned, put the tomatoes in the skillet with the sage, and let them get a nice glaze (turning up the skillet if you have to, but don't let them fall apart by cooking them too long, you want them to have a little structure). add to this the pasta and red sauce, let it simmer for just a few minutes, and start scooping this into a squash.

burny mushroom filling
---
- 2 cups finely minced shiitake mushrooms
- 1 cup minced celery
- 1 cup minced red onion
- 1/2 cup minced green onions ("spring onions")
- 1 bunch curly kale, de-stemmed, diced
- 1 package uptons italian seitan
- 3 large jalapeños
- a medium-bodied red wine

cut the jalapeños length-wise into strips (like you might see bell peppers cut for fajitas), preserving the meniscus, and throw in a skilet with coconut oil with the seitan. let them simmer on medium-high heat so they can brown. you will want to leave the hood vent on because the spray/vapor will irritate your throat & lungs. add the celery and onion when the jalapenos start to soften up a little bit. when the celery and onion begin to reduce, add a splash (1-2T) of the red wine, distributing throughout. i used a syrah.

when all this is pretty happy and starts to become somewhat squishy, make some space in the middle of the skillet, add a couple tablespoons of coconut oil, turn the heat up, and add the mushrooms. let them brown, and then reduce the heat back down to medium. add another sploosh of wine, stir some more, and repeat. last, add the spring onions and toss lightly. when everything seems pretty mingled and cooked, you should make plenty of space in the pan, turn the heat up again, add another tablespoon or two of oil, and add the kale, a handful at a time, letting it wilt in the heat and oil, and stirring it into the seitan mixture as it wilts. 

when all the kale is wilted and stirred into the seitain/mushroom mixture, remove from heat immediately (and remove from the stove and pan if possible), and stuff the squash.
