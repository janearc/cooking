basic squash filling
---
- 1 cup minced celery
- 2 cups minced red potatoes
- 1 cup minced red onion
- 1 cup minced green onion ("spring onions")
- 1/2 cup minced shallot
- 2T minced/shredded fresh sage
- 2 cups daiya mozzarella
- 1 package uptons italian seitan

sautee the potatoes in coconut oil until browning starts, seasoning with coarse salt and pepper. add to this the celery, red onion, shallot, and seitan, and add more coconut oil as this will dry out. as this browns and begins to cook, monitor your potatoes for doneness; once they start looking done, add the sage and green onion, turning frequently in the pan (the sage is delicate and you want to season with it, not burn it). when everything looks and smells pretty happy, remove from heat, add the daiya and turn so that it spreads evenly throughout the filling. make sure it cools and doesn't burn the cheese on the pan. when it's cooled a bit, you can start putting it in the squash.

tomatoey squash filling
---
- 1 package beyond beef crumbles
- 2 cups de cecco fusili
- 1 cup minced red onion
- 2 medium tomatoes, cut into eighths
- 2T minced/shredded fresh sage
- 1 pint tomato sauce (i seem to use "dave's gourmet" a lot?)

brown the beef in coconut oil with the onion in a skillet, seasoning with oregano, thyme, and rosemary to taste (or whatever works for you). while this is happening, cook the pasta and drain, setting it aside. when the beef is browned, put the tomatoes in the skillet with the sage, and let them get a nice glaze (turning up the skillet if you have to, but don't let them fall apart by cooking them too long, you want them to have a little structure). add to this the pasta and red sauce, let it simmer for just a few minutes, and start scooping this into a squash.
