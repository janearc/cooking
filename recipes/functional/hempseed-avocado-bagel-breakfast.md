hempseed avocado bagel breakfast
---
The breakfast I've been enjoying for months expands or contracts based upon my dietary requirements. It's neat to be able to have a meal that is so flexible, and to use to to sort of set the pace of the day.

I have a **whole avocado** (pro-tip: halve it, remove the pit, then score it down the middle, then score it diagonally both directions, and then push it from the skin out onto the bagel so you get cubes you can smush onto the bagel and spread, it's way easier) on toast, using more or less bread (bagel vs sliced) depending on how much carbs I will need before lunch because bread are slowish carbs.

I add **salt & pepper** to season (butter is of course salted, so avocado can seem a little bland).

I add 1-2 tablespoons (15-30ml) **shelled hemp seeds** (often called "hemp hearts") per slice of toast depending on how long it will be before I eat, and fold them into the avocado with a fork. Hemp seeds are nutritionally really dense and contain phosphorus, which helps prevent cramping from standing desks (I take a magnesium supplement).

At home, I add **olive oil** to the toast and **red pepper flakes** as well as **sprouts**.

I have this with **almond milk** which is light but fatty and aids digestion but doesn't contain caffeine.

I add a **banana** if I have morning meetings because I need quicker carbs, and usually add **green tea** for caffeine (you drink the tea, not pour it on the bagel, silly!).

I realise there are people out there who look at breakfast as just a meal and don't actually look at their calendar and evaluate what their breakfast should look like to be successful that day, but the difference is kind of profound.

This meal is incredibly flexible, and I vary it based upon what I am doing that day.

- 105 banana
- 230 avocado
- 245 bagel
- 160 4T hemp seeds
- 50mg caffeine (500ml Teas Tea oolong)
- 35 almond milk (8floz)
- = 775 calories, fast and slow carbs, with fats and caffeine.

vs:

- 230 avocado
- 80 hemp seeds
- 245 bagel
- 35 almond milk
- = 590 calories, no caffeine, slow carbs only, fat bias.
