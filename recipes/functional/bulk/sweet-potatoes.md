sweet potatoes
---
i used to need to be able to get > 5,000 calories a day and that was hard,
especially eating food that was made at home, and was what i considered to
be "clean" food. at the time i was adherent to the [whole9 diet](http://whole9life.com/faq/),
so sweet potatoes fit pretty well. you can make basically an unlimited amount
of sweet potatoes if you just get the station set up to do peeling and then
"topping" them and putting them in tupperware when they come out of the oven.
they'll keep for at least a week (longer in the freezer), and if you're feeding
two people, you could cook twenty potatoes and feed two people for a week quite
easily in one afternoon.

anyways, peel sweet potatoes. section into large chunks, roughly the size of
half or a third of the potato. cover each with **coconut oil**. season with:

- cinnamon
- allspice
- ground clove
- flake salt
- black pepper
- raw coconut sugar (to taste, optional)

bake in the oven on parchment paper or aluminium foil on a cookie sheet at
350Â°F for about an hour. when they're done, take them out and put them in
tupperware. they're fine cold but you can reheat them in the microwave for
30-60 seconds. also consider adding coconut oil when you reheat, or if you are
feeling saucy, maple syrup.
