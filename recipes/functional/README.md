functional meals
---
**If you are someone who is sensitive about calorie counting, this may not be the place for you.** Because of the way I work and live, I sometimes go too long without eating or for whatever reason I need to be aware of how many calories I am getting into my person in a given day. Because of this, it is convenient to be able to "know a good way to get enough calories" without really thinking "is this enough?" or "is this too much?" and also to feel like I am not eating garbage (because one can simply eat 800 calories of triscuit and peanut butter and be done with it as well, but what is the point?).

Because of this, I wind up cooking the same meal over and over again and iterating on it once I find something I like and that works, is nutritionally reasonable, and provides enough calories that it could be considered enough to feed an adult person for half a day or maybe even a whole day if you had to (that is, if you ate nothing but this one meal and left the house, and slept somewhere else, how would you feel the following day?). I try to make them flexible so that I can add things to them easily like a sauce, rice, condiment, and so on, that will increase their nutritional value or caloric density. Triscuit and peanut butter is not real flexible. Fried rice really is.
