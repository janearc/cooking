everything starts with tofu
---
As I write this, I have no fewer than fifty blocks of tofu in my home of various consistency and flavour. because it keeps essentially forever in the mori-nu sterile packs, and it comes in such a wide assortment, it really is a perfect base for a meal you want to have in your kitchen kind of at all times.

* One block of mori-nu tofu contains about 180 calories.
* One tablespoon of coconut oil is about 130 calories.

### Breakfast:

for breakfast, I try to keep both chorizo and bacon texture upton's seitan in the fridge. Depending on my mood, I will use either the chorizo or the bacon seitan and make a scramble (the recipe is elsewhere in this repository) with the tofu. If I am very hungry, I add daiya shredded cheddar cheese to this, which is another 90 calories, and put it in a tortilla, which is another 150 calories. With an entire block of tofu, and an entire box of seitan, this is enough to be two servings.

- Tofu (180)
- Seitan (250)
- Coconut oil (130)
- Tortillas (300)
- Daiya (90)

So this is anywhere from 560 to 950 calories, usually split into two servings, and is a nice balance of fats, protein, and carbs.

### Dinner:

For dinner, I usually start with two blocks of the nigari firm tofu or the regular extra-firm tofu and I cut it into cubes, simply pan-frying it to get a bit of a "crust" on it. For this, I use a bit of sesame oil (40 calories/tsp) and soy sauce (essentially, you use very high heat to evaporate the soy sauce to get the malted flavour out of the sauce rather than cook with the sauce directly; it's complicated). I season with white pepper, black pepper, and a good amount of salt. I use whatever vegetables seem friendly; there just aren't enough calories in most of the vegetables I add here to make much difference. Bell peppers have more calories per volume than many other vegetables but are nutritionally kind of empty; bok choi is nutritionally dense but doesn't have as many calories; kale is probably the winner in both categories but has a challenging texture. It's best to just find something you like and will eat and work with that. The goal is to eat food.

- Tofu (360)
- Coconut oil (130)
- Veggies 4c, (100-180)

It's a quick meal in that I can dice up veggies and two blocks of tofu and get ~640 calories in me after work with relatively little time. I usually pick up the vegetables at the farmer's market on the way home from Bart.
