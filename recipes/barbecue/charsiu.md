char siu
---
char siu is a kind of chinese barbecued meat. it has a very distinctive red colour and is usually pork although you will occasionally see chicken and duck and beef.

this recipe mostly concerns the sauce. typically what you'd do with this is make the sauce (enough is provided here for sixteen ounces of seitan; my suggestion is to double or quadruple this recipe and put it in the fridge -- but it will spoil, so be careful), and then marinate the meat product, and serve it with a meal on rolls like bao or pandesal (there's a recipe in this repository) with a larger meal.

ingredients:
- 2 T minced garlic
- 2 T minced crimini mushroom
- 2 T maple syrup
- 2 T sesame oil
- 1 T coconut oil
- 1 t chinese 5-spice mix
- 4 T rice wine
- 2 T hoisin sauce
- 2 T thai chili sauce
- 2 T extra dark soy sauce
- 4 t molasses
- food colouring (red)

in a saucepan on very low heat, heat the garlic, mushroom, maple syrup, sesame, and coconut oil. as it begins to caramelise (because there's a bunch of sugar in the pan), add the food colouring and start adding the rest of the ingredients, stirring enough to prevent it from hardening.

when all this is added to the saucepan, let it simmer (on the *lowest* heat), you can either remove to a separate vessel, or you can pour it over your seitan (or whatever) in a ziplock and marinate overnight to let the colour sink in and the flavours accumulate (it's pretty pungent, so it's not strictly necessary). when served with warm bao, it's a pretty great meal all by itself.

**A note on colouring**: firstly, the colouring is optional, but char siu is red. the colouring i use in mine is literally called "beet red" and comes from beets, and is more pink. the way to get it red is to add a packet of red to a bit of a packet of yellow. this recipe requires two packets of red and one packet of yellow. if you are using those liquid food dye droppers, you'll have to improvise and figure out how that works. be advised that some of these dyes are not vegan (and they may not state this on the package).
