kids granola
---
most of my granola i make for me. however, i made granola in 2016 around the holidays with the deliberate intent to be exciting for kids. the taste of "salty-sweet-booze" is kind of not something that a) kids appreciate or b) that is something that is really appropriate for kids besides (lack of ethyl alcohol notwithstanding).

so i've made two recipes here, one with booze, and one without. the booze recipe is aimed more at the adults associated with the kids to whom i was giving granola, and the kids recipe is of course booze-free and sweeter.

ingredients (kids):
- 2 cups dried oats
- 1/2 cup banana chips, sweetened, minced
- 1/4 tsp ginger
- 1 tsp maldon sea salt, ground finely
- 4 T hemp seeds
- 1/2 cup maple syrup
- 1/2 cup golden raisins
- 1 cup fruit loops (fruit loops aren't vegan; i use cascadian farms fruitful o's)

ingredients (adults):
- 2 cups dried oats
- 1/2 cup banana chips, sweetened, minced
- 1/2 cup minced dark chocolate pieces
- 1/4 tsp clove
- 1/4 tsp ginger
- 1 tsp maldon sea salt
- 4 T hemp seeds
- 1/2 cup maple syrup
- 1/2 cup cranberries (or tart cherries)
- 2 T dark rum

combine all ingredients in a bowl, stir thoroughly, and cook at 350Â°F for 12-15 minutes on an oiled cookie sheet. let cool in pan, and then remove with a spatula, leaving larger chunks (the chocolate will have melted). it should keep a while.
