salty nibs granola
---
i found myself wanting to eat the roasted/salted almonds i'd bought from whole foods all by themselves so instead i made granola with them to feel less bad about eating them by themselves.

ingredients:
- 2 cups dried oats
- 1 cup roasted, salted almonds
- 1/8 tsp clove
- 1/8 tsp allspice
- 1 tsp coarse maldon sea salt
- 4T hemp seeds
- 2T cacao nibs
- 2T earth balance butter (melted)
- .5c maple syrup
- .5c raisins

combined all ingredients in a large bowl, stirred until uniform, placed on a cookie sheet and baked at 350Â°F for 15 minutes. like the other granola recipes here, this will keep longer than it will take you to eat it if you store it in an airtight container on the shelf.
