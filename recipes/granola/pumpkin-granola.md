pumpkin granola
---
This is a spicier, more "spiced rum" version of pumpkin spice granola. I double this recipe.

to season ("pumpkin spice")
---
- 1 tsp cinnamon
- 1 tsp ginger
- .75 tsp allspice
- .75 tsp clove
- .75 tsp nutmeg

dry ingredients
---
- 4T hemp seeds
- 4T chia seeds
- 1.5c rolled oats
- .5c dried cherries
- .5c cashews

wet ingredients
---
- 1T dark rum
- 1.5T pumpkin
- 1.5T butter
- .5c maple syrup
- .5 tsp vanilla extract

combine wet ingredients separately, but thoroughly, and then fold into dry ingredients, and lay flat on cookie sheets. Bake at 350Â°F for 20 minutes on a lightly oiled cookie sheet and store in an airtight tupperware.
