pumpkin granola
---
This is a spicier, more "spiced rum" version of pumpkin spice granola. I double this recipe. If you double it, you may want to actually take it out at one point (15 minutes in, perhaps), stir it, and place it back in and let it cook another 5-ish minutes to make sure it gets cooked thoroughly – the pumpkin in it *needs to cook*.

to season ("pumpkin spice")
---
- 1 tsp cinnamon
- 1 tsp ginger
- .75 tsp allspice
- .75 tsp clove
- .75 tsp nutmeg

dry ingredients
---
- 4T hemp seeds
- 4T chia seeds
- 1.5c rolled oats
- .5c dried cherries
- .5c cashews

wet ingredients
---
- 1T dark rum (you can go with more here, it cooks off and is for flavour)
- 1.5T **pumpkin pulp**
- 1.5T butter
- .5c maple syrup
- .5 tsp vanilla extract

combine wet ingredients separately, but thoroughly, and then fold into dry ingredients, and lay flat on cookie sheets. Bake at 350°F for 20 minutes on a lightly oiled cookie sheet and store in an airtight tupperware.
