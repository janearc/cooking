blackberry granola bars
---
These are more cookies than bars but bear a superficial resemblence to granola bars.

ingredients
---
- 4T earth balance butter alike
- 2T cointreau
- 1C blackberries, fresh
- zest of one lemon
- 3C dry rolled oats
- 4T hemp hearts
- 3T marzipan
- .5c maple syrup

dissolve the marzipan, maple syrup, butter, and cointreau together in a saucepan on low heat; this will take a little time and some stirring. it is easier if all these things start at room temperature.

in a large bowl, place the lemon zest, oats, and hemp hearts. mix thoroughly.

preheat oven to 350Â°F.

grease a cookie sheet (coconut oil seems fine).

pour the wet mixture into the dry ingredients and stir until it seems happy, and then add the blackberries.

you can use cookie cutters (I used dinosaurs and cowboys because of course I did, but something vaguely rectangle might make more sense), or you could just use the whole pan and cut it up afterwards. If you use cookie cutters, you would place the "granola" mixture into the cookie cutters as molds.

cook for fifteen minutes. store as you would granola. the marzipan binds it pretty well so they will be pretty stiff and can be eaten like cookies.
