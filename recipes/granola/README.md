granola

I have long been interested in granola as a vegetarian because it is high in calories and touted as a "healthy food." While this is mostly debunked (as most store-bought granola is high in sugar and other carbohydrates), the other problem granola presents to the vegan consumer is that it is generally not vegan in that it contains honey.

Some vegans don't feel strongly about honey, and I consider myself to be someone who feels strongly enough about honey to have learned how to make granola for myself, but not strongly enough to "avoid" honey-containing items if I need food at e.g., a gas station on a road trip.

Don't start making your own granola if you want to ever enjoy store-bought granola again. I had a "favourite brand" and everything, and I just can't anymore.

That having been said, let's explain how granola works.

how to granola

The general components of a granola are:

- some kind of dried oat or grain basis
- some kind of fruit(s), dried
- some kind of nuts
- some kind of sweetener which is also an emulsifier (this is important)
- sometimes an additional fat or oil is used
- spices/seasonings are used to change the character of the above

Generally in order for the granola to both "hold together" and to remain "shelf stable" (that is to be non-perishable for lengths of time outside your fridge), you will need to keep the ratio of your emulsifying sweetener (like maple syrup) to your base (like grain/oat) on the order of 1:2. So, for example, you might have an emulsifier of bourbon, maple syrup, marzipan, and coconut oil that add up to .75 cups to hold 1.5 cups of oats. This would be very stable. Conversely, if there were more of the emulsifier, the mixture would come out more like cookies or cookie dough and require refrigeration (this is not necessarily a *bad* thing, but it's not really *granola*, either). Anyways.

Moving right along, a very simple vegan granola would consist of:

- rolled oats
- maple syrup
- almonds
- dried apricots
- coconut oil

The proportions change based upon the character you want in the granola; whether you want it to be sweeter, more filling, more savoury, crunchier, to have bigger "clumps," whether you want to add things like chia seeds or hemp hearts, and so on.

And almost all preparation of granola will indicate preparing the wet ingredients (your fat and emulsifier -- the sweetener) separately, and then combining it with the dry ingredients, stirring completely, and then baking.

An interesting side effect of this is you can form this granola into bars and indeed make "granola bars," just as you see in the grocery store. You can use cookie cutters as moulds for this, but it is tricky.

Baking granola makes your home smell heavenly.

I've made a lot of granolas that varied from dry to wet, cookies and bars to cereals and so forth, and the ones I come back to the most are the ones I have made with oats, nuts, and a single fruit.

I tend to go with McCann's 3-minute oats (for oatmeal) because their texture is just better than the bulk oats I buy from e.g., whole foods and it makes my granola taste better.

Because almost all of my granola is consumed as a morning cereal, the "spice blend" that winds up in the granola becomes pretty important, and even over-seasoning it is okay, because this winds up in the bowl and I wind up drinking the (almond-) milk anyways. This may not be true if you are making something to eat dry for e.g., hiking. You can actually put pumpkin and other vegetables in granola because it is baked, making it quite filling, as well as marzipan. At any rate, I also find that I enjoy things like bourbon or cointreau as an accent in granola because it just feels quite decadent to have a splash of bourbon in your breakfast cereal (there's no actual alcohol, so what's the harm?).

It's not necessary to go overboard in finding fancy ingredients to put in your granola; dried fruit and nuts are generally pretty similar. If you were to bias spending, spend money on better oats and better "super" ingredients like cacao nibs, chia and hemp seeds which are much more nutritionally dense and valuable.
