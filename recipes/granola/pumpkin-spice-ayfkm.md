are you effen kidding me granola
---
Really, don't even ask. You will notice the **pumpkin spice** combination of cinnamon/ginger/allspice/clove, and the other pieces of "decadent granola." This is not health food, and should probably not be considered food, except the fact that it is *so good* you want to eat it all the time.

pumpkin spice
---
- 1 tsp cinnamon
- 1 tsp ginger
- .75 tsp allspice
- .25 tsp clove

dry ingredients
---
- 4T hemp seeds
- 4T chia seeds
- 1.5c rolled oats
- .5c dried cranberries

wet ingredients
---
- 1T bourbon
- 1.5T marzipan
- 1.5T coconut oil
- .5c maple syrup
- .5tsp vanilla extract

Combine wet ingredients on low heat in saucepan. It will take effort to get marzipan to dissolve into the maple syrup and coconut oil but you will be rewarded for your efforts. Stir with a spatula. Add the pumpkin spice. Add to dry ingredients.

Cook in a 350Â°F for 15 minutes on a lightly oiled cookie sheet and store in an airtight tupperware. It won't last.
