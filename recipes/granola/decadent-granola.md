decadent granola
---
I was in a mood for cherries and marzipan and I coincidentally happened to be out of granola. Well, there was only one solution.

dry ingredients
---
- 1.5 cup oats
- .5c dried cherries
- .5c dry coconut flakes unsweetened, dried
- .5c almonds, salted
- 4T hemp seeds
- 4T chia seeds

wet ingredients
---
- 1 tsp vanilla extract
- 1.5T marzipan
- .5tsp cinnamon
- .5tsp coconut oil
- .5 cup dark maple syrup

Pre-heat oven to 350Â°F & oil pan lightly. place wet ingredients in a small sauce pan, and stir lightly. it will take effort to get the marzipan to dissolve into the syrup mixture, but it will eventually.

Combine dry ingredients. Pour the wet ingredients evenly over the dry ingredients, and stir judiciously, making sure they are evenly distributed. Place on cookie sheet and bake 30 minutes, more if the granola is not crispy/cooked enough.
