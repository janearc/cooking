# Smoked Eel & Buttery Potato Smash (Café Pupjes Style)

A rich, comforting, and slightly briny dish that feels like a warm hug after a cold canal walk. Inspired by Dutch tradition, built for resilience.

## Ingredients (Serves 4)

### Potatoes:
- 1.5 kg waxy potatoes (e.g., Yukon Gold), skin on
- 100 g butter, cold and cubed
- 100 ml heavy cream *(optional, for extra richness)*
- Salt, to taste
- Freshly ground black pepper, to taste

### Eel & Garnish:
- 300 g smoked eel fillets, boned and skinned
- 3 scallions, finely sliced
- 2 tbsp capers, rinsed and chopped
- Pickled red onions *(optional, for brightness)*
- Fresh dill, roughly chopped *(optional)*

- 3 tbsp olive oil
- Pinch of salt

## Instructions

### 1. Boil the Potatoes:
- Scrub the potatoes and cut into large chunks.
- Place in a large pot of salted water and bring to a boil.
- Simmer until fork-tender, ~20–25 minutes.
- Drain and return to the hot pot to steam off excess moisture.

### 2. Make the Potato Smash:
- Roughly smash the potatoes with butter and cream (if using).
- Season generously with salt and black pepper.
- Fold in half of the scallions and capers for subtle brightness.

### 3. Warm the Eel:
- Gently warm smoked eel in a dry pan over low heat or in a 160°C oven for 5 minutes.
- Flake into bite-sized pieces. Avoid crisping it—keep it supple and oily.

### 4. Make the Bright Sauce *(Optional)*:
- Whisk marmalade, mustard, vinegar, and olive oil until emulsified.
- Taste and adjust: it should balance sweet, tangy, and sharp notes.

### 5. Assemble:
- Spoon buttery smashed potatoes into bowls or onto plates.
- Scatter the warm smoked eel on top.
- Drizzle with bright sauce or a squeeze of lemon juice.
- Garnish with remaining scallions, chopped capers, pickled onions, and dill.

## Notes

- **Seasonality Tip**: This dish shines in autumn and winter, but works year-round with good potatoes.
- **Late-Night Version**: Swap mash for crisp fried potato coins and serve with sambal-mayo or yuzu aioli.
- **Vibe Check**: This is for people who’ve *been through it*. Serve hot, serve proud.
