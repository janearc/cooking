tofu scramble
---
a tofu scramble is the basis of any dish that formerly required scrambled eggs. it's actually really easy to do and you may need to practise it a few times to get it right so be prepared to waste a few blocks of silken tofu, but after you've done it a few times the skill is easy.

get a box (the shelf-stable box kind, not the whole foods, sits in the fridge kind) of **silken tofu**, cut it along the sides, and slide it out onto a plate. drain it as best you can, maybe quartering it, but it is very fragile stuff.

use a wok (I use a [Breville electric wok](https://smile.amazon.com/Brevile-BREBEW800XL-Breville-Hot-Wok/dp/B00BTZIPH0/)) or a high-walled skillet, and heat coconut oil to high heat (not quite smoking, but about "stir-fry" temperature).

when the oil is good and hot (about 30ml per box of tofu), begin adding the tofu in pieces, about one-quarter-box-full at a time. it will brown quickly. as it browns, toss rapidly with a silicone spatula (plastic will melt in the heat):

- add **turmeric** for earthy taste, the yellowy colour of egg;
- **rosemary** to taste
- **coriander** to taste
- coarse **salt**, to taste (I just pinch this with my hands, and I use Maldon salt because I like it)
- **black pepper** (I grew up with [tellicherry pepper](http://www.seriouseats.com/2012/07/taste-test-black-pepper-what-are-differences-in-varieties.html), and prefer it))
- **white pepper** to taste

more "tossing" leads to fluffier tofu, and the more drained the tofu is before hand, the fluffier and less runny it is, as well as the less splatter you get from water in your oil (which should be very hot). depending on how you like your "eggs", more runny may be desirable.

because the tofu is not an animal product, and there are no animal fats, this is cooked from the moment you put it into the wok, so do not worry about it being under cooked; just make sure it is seasoned the way you want. by continually tossing it with the spatula, you are aiming for the desired *consistency* of the tofu (which is why the silken tofu is used), so continue to break down the chunks into smaller chunks, and toss continually to avoid baking a crust onto any pieces.

when it is thoroughly warmed, seasoned, and begins to look like a scrambled egg, remove from heat, and place on a serving dish or in ramekins and this can then be used either in subsequent recipes (such as chilaquiles) or plated as-is.
