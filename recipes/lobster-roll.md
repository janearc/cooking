## Instructions

1. **Prepare the Caper-Dill Cream**  
   In a small bowl, mix crÃ¨me fraÃ®che, chopped capers, dill, Dijon mustard, and lemon juice.  
   Season with salt and pepper to taste. Aim for a tangy, creamy, and briny balance.

   Add lemon juice, season lightly with salt and pepper, then remove from heat.

4. **Toast the Buns**  
   Brush the sides of each bun with melted butter.  
   Toast in a hot skillet until golden brown and crispy on the outside.

5. **Assemble the Rolls**  
   - Spread a generous layer of caper-dill cream inside each bun.  
   - Add cabbage or lettuce if using.  
   - Fill with warm buttered lobster.
