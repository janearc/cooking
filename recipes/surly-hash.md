Kale is pretty resilient to spoilage in the fridge, at least the non-"baby kale" variety. Whole foods calls this "curly kale," and it can be a little tough to eat raw (this doesn't work with the kale you get in a bag). Most people use this as a component in smoothies and so forth, but it has a lovely taste and texture. It's also a very nutritious vegetable and contains things that are tough to get from e.g., fruit (such as magnesium) and other vegetables.

Prepare the kale by removing the stalks -- I find it's pretty tough to do anything useful with this. I use about three cups per serving when I prepare this for myself (per one sweet potato). I chop the kale fairly finely, somewhere between diced and minced, where it's still fluffy and resembles a vegetable and not pesto.

You will need cubed (centimeter-ish) sweet potato (which you probably have in your fridge). If they've been previously frozen, they'll take less time to cook. Let them cook in a wok, covered, on medium-high heat in coconut oil until they are tender, tossing or stirring every few minutes. When they seem done, turn the heat up to high to give them a good glaze, and then turn the heat down to low.

To season the sweet potatoes, use:
- 1/4 tsp turmeric
- 1/8 tsp ginger
- 1/8 tsp coriander
- red pepper flakes to taste
- liberal salt flakes to taste

Add the kale to the sweet potatoes, and let the kale wilt, but only just. Stir the kale continually, and add a touch of salt (yes, more). The kale needs to wilt, but not "cook." The idea is for the kale to wilt and to pick up some of the flavour and the coconut oil from the potatoes, but not for it to be wrecked in the wok by the heat.

This shouldn't even take two minutes. Pull the admixture out quickly and let it cool briefly, and serve immediately.
