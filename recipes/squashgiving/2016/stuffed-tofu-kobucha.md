kobucha engastration
---
i had kind of been on an engastration kick and this one turned out really nicely. i had two kobucha squashes that were about 6" diameter. originally i wanted to serve them with pasta, but decided instead to just serve them with tofu and a vegan meat product.

ingredients
- 2 kobucha squash (i used 6", one red, one green; the red seems more suited to this recipe)
- 1 package beyond meat brand beef crumbles
- daiya mozarella shreds
- sage fresh to taste
- 1 box mori-nu brand silken tofu
- 2 red jalapeños
- 2 whole green onions, diced
- 1 pint red sauce

make a fluffy, fine tofu scramble as described elsewhere in this repository, using salt, pepper, thyme, and oregano to taste, and mince some fresh sage as well. let this cook a while, to get rid of some of the moisture, but stir it continually so that it does not brown. as it dries a bit, add a full package of the beef crumbles, and add some coconut or olive oil liberally. add more sage, more salt, and more pepper.

let this cook a while, stirring continually so that everything heats evenly, and don't be afraid to let it brown a little.

remove the meniscus (the white part) and the seeds from the jalapeños and mince them finely and add them to the tofu mixture, and stir it so they're not all sitting in one place.

when this seems pretty cooked, remove this to a large saucepan and add the red sauce (whichever you like, or make your own). let the red sauce simmer for about fifteen minutes and remove from heat.

at this point begin marking the squashes for removing their tops. use the point of a paring knife to indicate where you intend to cut, and circle the top such that you can move around within the squash . they are a little thicker than you might expect (if you have worked within pumpkins); they are about like an acorn squash. begin cutting into them when the incision matches, and then lever the knife away from yourself; you should hear an audible "pop" when the top of the squash is separated. clean out the inside of the squash using a knife and spoon, compost the guts.

fill the squashes with the red sauce and top with daiya. then add the lid and cook for about ninety minutes at 350°F. remove the lid, cook another 30 minutes. the squashes should be cooked on parchment or aluminium foil; they will weep a little (but that's because they are so beautiful).

to serve, scoop out the squash with the sauce onto plate and serve with stuffing. it's pretty great.
