fennel apple shiitake stuffing
---
these values are approximate. this produces a *lot* of food. i had never made stuffing without some kind of broth before (i discovered that my vegetarian broth had gone bad six months earlier when i went to make the stuffing that morning), and had to recover that moisture.

another note - i never throw away bread. i keep odds and ends for bread puddings and croutons and so forth. accordingly, i had a batch of pumpkin biscuits that had failed to rise but were otherwise fine for use in a stuffing.

lastly, i have a tiny tiny kitchen because i live in the bay area; if you have more space, you may be able to do this more quickly by using multiple burners, bowls, pans, etcetera. this is very procedural and is dictated by my kitchen.

ingredients:
- 1 c shiitake minced finely
- 1 c fennel minced
- "some" sage, fresh, minced very finely (3T perhaps?)
- 1 c shallot minced
- 1 c white pearl onions, peeled
- 2 fuji apples diced
- 4 c red potatoes
- 4 c stale sour batard diced
- 1 c pumpkin biscuits (joy of cooking) diced
- 1 package upton's italian seitan
- 1 bunch parsley
- 1 bunch rosemary, fresh

brown the seitan in a few tablespoons of coconut oil with the shiitake, fenel, shallot, sage, and a quarter cup of the apples, leaving the rest aside. season with black pepper and coarse flake salt. don't be afraid to let it get pretty wet. the seitan isn't especially oily, and none of these ingredients carry much moisture. when it's pretty cooked and browned and the shallots have reduced a bit, remove all of this to a large bowl.

next place the potatoes and apples in the pan, and brown them. also season with black pepper and flake salt. add a large sprig of rosemary, but break it in half so it's two pieces (call them 3-4" each). also let them get wet. the apples should add some moisture to the potatoes. when they're pretty browned, remove the rosemary (do not let the apples fall apart; the whole mixture will be going into the oven to cook, so the potatoes do not need to be *fully* cooked, but they must be pretty cooked), and remove the whole mixture to the large bowl that your seitan is resting in.

next, place the biscuits and other bread pieces in the pan you've been cooking everything else in. add a bunch of olive oil, and brown the bread. it is probably pretty stale bread that you've been keeping in your freezer if you're like me. so you are going to want to make sure that this cooks, and to toss this quite a bit, and make sure that it does in fact brown; don't, however, let it get a sort of "second crust" on it. when you're done, put it in the large bowl, and stir the whole mixture together with a spatula, letting everything get cozy, and intermingled. the "woody" and "earthy" flavours that are familiar to omnivores from stuffing come from the shiitake, so you want the seitan part to come into contact with the rest, and to just sit for a while.

throw the pearl onions in the bowl, mince a handful of parsley, put that in there, too, and have a glass of wine.

when you have finished the wine and given everything another stir, nuke about 1/4 cup (4T) of butter and look for anything that seems dry and sort of do a drizzle-on-the-dry-spots run while stirring. then pour the whole thing into a stoneware pan (i already had a bread pudding in my larger pan, so i used a 9x10), and cover the whole thing with aluminium foil.

bake at 350°F for 45 minutes. at that time, you may remove the foil and increase temperature to about 400°F and cook for another 10 minutes to brown the top.
