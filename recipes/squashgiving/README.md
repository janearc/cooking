what is a squashgiving
---
It seems odd to call it a "thanksgiving" meal when there is no large bird involved. There are so many dishes that stem from the preparation of various animal fats that many of the things that come from thanksgiving meals are just nonsensical when prepared vegan and I kind of choose not to. I will make pumpkin dishes all day long, but rather than try to make some kind of "tofucken" (yes, it exists), I choose to instead make a meal with friends. The stores are full of squashes and gourds and so on at this time of year. I became vegan in 2016. Accordingly, the first recipes in this repository were from Squashgiving 2016; it was just two of us, Susan and myself. Cooking for two is always tough, and cooking *giving for two is nigh impossible. But, as my friend Hilary used to say, "food equals love," and I've no problem cooking a meal for friends and family.
