# Zoet & Zilt  
_Smoked Trout, Fig Preserves & Creamy Cheese on Toasted Boerenbrood_

## Ingredients (serves 8)

* 16 slices boerenbrood (farmhouse bread), thick-cut
* 200 g fig preserves
* 300 g creamy farmhouse cheese (brie, camembert, goat cheese)
* 240 g smoked trout fillet, flaked
* Black pepper
* 2 lemons, cut in wedges

### Homemade Fig Preserves (makes \~2 jars)

* 1 kg ripe figs, chopped
* 300 g granulated sugar
* 2 tbsp honey (30 ml)
* 2 tbsp cider vinegar (30 ml)
* Zest of 2 lemons
* Optional: 2 sprigs fresh thyme or a pinch cinnamon

## Instructions

### If making the fig preserves:
1. Combine all preserve ingredients in a medium saucepan over low heat.
2. Stir gently until the sugar dissolves, then simmer uncovered for 30–40 minutes, stirring occasionally, until thick and jammy.
3. Remove thyme sprig if used. Let cool, then store in a sterilized jar.

### To assemble Zoet & Zilt:
1. Lightly toast the boerenbrood slices until golden on the edges but still soft in the center.
2. Spread a generous layer of fig preserves on each slice.
3. Lay slices of creamy cheese over the fig layer. Let them soften slightly from the warmth of the toast.
4. Top with flaked smoked trout.
5. Crack black pepper over the top. Add a few drops of lemon juice if desired.
6. Serve immediately, ideally with a cold glass of PJ Cider™.

## Notes

- **Cheese tip**: Use something soft and mild, but with a little earthiness to balance the sweetness—goat cheese, double cream brie, or even a fresh herbed quark if you’re going local.
- **Preserves tip**: You can age the fig preserves for a few weeks with a splash more cider vinegar for depth.
