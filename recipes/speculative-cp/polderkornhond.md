- 60g Amsterdam pickles (Amsterdamse uitjes or zuur), minced
- Salt and white pepper
- Neutral oil for frying
- 16 sturdy wooden skewers

### Filling Prep
1. **Crisp the Speck:**  
   - Pan-fry diced speck in a dry skillet until golden and crunchy. Drain well on paper towels.
2. **Sauté Cabbage:**  
   - In the same pan, cook shredded cabbage with a pinch of salt until wilted and most moisture is gone. Cool to room temp.
3. **Combine:**  
   - In a big bowl, mix cabbage, crispy speck, minced pickles. Season with white pepper and a little salt. Make sure the filling is *dry*—pat with a paper towel if needed.

### Assembly
1. **Place a cheese baton and a big spoonful of filling in the lower third of the wrapper.**
2. **Insert a wooden skewer through the cheese and filling, leaving enough stick to hold.**
3. **Roll up egg roll tightly, folding in sides, sealing the edge with a little water/flour paste. Make sure ends are closed to keep cheese in.**
4. **Set on a tray seam side down. Repeat for all rolls.**

### Double Frying
1. **First Fry:**  
   - Heat oil to 160°C. Fry egg rolls in batches until lightly golden and crisp (about 2–3 min). Drain and cool on a rack.  
2. **Rest:**  
   - Let egg rolls cool at least 10 minutes, or refrigerate for later service.
3. **Second Fry:**  
   - Reheat oil to 180–185°C. Fry egg rolls again until deeply golden, bubbly, and crisp (about 1–2 min). Drain, skewer up, and serve hot.

### Serving
- Serve immediately on a stick.
