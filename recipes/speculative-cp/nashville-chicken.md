Instructions
	1.	Buttermilk Dip:
Mix buttermilk, pepper, paprika, garlic powder, and cayenne. Dunk brined chicken, coat well.
	2.	Flour Dredge:
Combine all dry dredge ingredients in a big bowl. Add blitzed brioche croutons if you want extra crunch.
	3.	Dredge Chicken:
Remove chicken from buttermilk, let excess drip off. Coat thoroughly in flour mix, pressing in. Rest on a rack for at least 10 minutes to set the crust.
	4.	Fry:
Heat oil to 175°C. Fry chicken in batches, 8–12 minutes per piece, until golden and cooked through. Drain on a rack. Save some hot oil for the wash if you want extra flavor.
	5.	Make the Ghost Butter Wash:
Gently melt butter in a small saucepan (don’t brown it). Whisk in ghost pepper sauce—up to 1:1 ratio for full insanity. Add cayenne, brown sugar, paprika, garlic powder, and salt. Whisk until smooth and emulsified.
	6.	Coat Chicken:
While chicken is still hot, brush or spoon the butter/ghost pepper mixture all over. Get into every crunchy nook. Let it soak in.
	7.	Serve:
Stack chicken on white bread, layer with pickles. Brace yourself.
