## Method

1. **Boil the Potatoes**  
   Place potatoes in a large pot and cover with cold salted water.  
   Bring to a boil and simmer for about 20 minutes, or until fork-tender.  
   Drain well.

2. **Sauté the Cabbage**  
   While the potatoes are cooking, melt half the butter in a skillet over medium heat.  
   Add cabbage and the scallion whites. Sauté for 8–10 minutes until tender and lightly browned.  
   Stir in Dijon mustard and apple cider vinegar. Season with salt and pepper.

3. **Warm the Cream Mixture**  
   In a small saucepan, gently heat the cream (or milk) with the remaining butter until steaming but not boiling.

4. **Mash and Combine**  
   Mash the drained potatoes until smooth.  
   Fold in the warm cream mixture, sautéed cabbage, scallion greens, and marmalade.  
   Season to taste with salt, pepper, and more vinegar if needed.

5. **Serve**  
   Spoon into bowls and finish with a pat of butter.  
   Add any optional toppings for a heartier, late-night version.

## Notes

- Marmalade brings a subtle brightness and bitterness that balances the buttery richness—don't skip it.
- For an elevated brunch plate, serve with a fried duck egg and crisp duck sausage coins.
- For late night: Chill leftovers, roll into balls, bread and deep-fry for Colcannon Bitterballen.
