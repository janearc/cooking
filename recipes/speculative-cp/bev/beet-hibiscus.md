# Druivenheks Beet-Hibiscus Iced Tea Mead

## Ingredients (for 8 liters / 8 servings)*

* 2 small beets, peeled and chopped
* 50 g dried hibiscus petals (or 5–6 hibiscus tea bags)
* 5–6 tbsp loose Ceylon tea (or 8 black tea bags)
* 4 lemons (zest and juice)
* 2.4–3 kg sugar (or 1.4 kg honey + 1.2 kg sugar)
* 1 tsp citric acid (optional, to taste)
* Water to 8 liters
* 2 packets Lalvin K1-V1116 yeast (or any cold-tolerant wine yeast)

## Step-by-Step

1. **Cold Extract:**
   - In a large jar or pitcher, combine chopped beet, hibiscus, Ceylon tea, lemon zest, and juice.
   - Add 1 liter cold water. Let steep overnight in the fridge (or sous vide at 55–60°C for 2 hours).

2. **Strain:**
   - Strain out solids, pressing gently to extract liquid. Discard or compost solids.

3. **Make the Must:**
   - Pour infusion into your fermenter.
   - Add sugar/honey and enough water to reach 1 gallon/4L. Stir to dissolve.
   - Check gravity (aim for OG 1.110–1.120 for ~14–16% ABV).
   - Taste; add citric acid if extra brightness is desired.

4. **Pitch Yeast:**
   - When must is room temp, pitch K1-V1116 yeast.
   - Fit with airlock.

5. **Ferment:**
   - Keep at 15–18°C (cool room) for clean flavor and bright color.
   - Ferment 2–4 weeks, until bubbling stops.

6. **Rack and Age:**
   - Rack off lees, taste, and optionally add more cold-steeped tea or lemon to finish.
   - Bottle, chill, and serve over ice with lemon wheel.

## Notes

- Beet is strong! Use a small one for color; taste before adding more.
- Hibiscus can be tart—balance with honey or sugar.
- Ceylon tea adds “iced tea” energy—cold-steep for mellow astringency.
- Lemon keeps color vivid and taste refreshing.

**Druivenheks pro tip:**  
The color on this is unreal. Serve in clear glass and watch people’s faces light up!
