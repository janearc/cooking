# Zomerhitte Julep Mead (Druivenheks Style)

## Ingredients
- 1 medium watermelon (including some rind, well-washed)
- 1 cup raspberries
- 1 cup chopped apricots (fresh or dried, pit removed)
- Zest of 1–2 lemons or limes
- 1 kg honey (or enough to reach 18% ABV in 4–5L batch)
- Granulated sugar (for extraction, up to 300g as needed)
- K1-V1116 yeast (or similar fruit-forward wine/mead yeast)
- Pinch of salt (to finish)
- Optional: fresh mint or basil for muddling/serving
- Water to top up (as needed)

## Steps

1. **Macerate Fruit:**
   - Cube watermelon (including a bit of rind), muddle with raspberries, apricots, citrus zest, and 200–300g sugar.
   - Let sit at room temp, covered, for 24–36 hours to draw out juice (“jusification”).

2. **(Optional) Lacto Sour Step:**
   - Add 1–2 Tbsp sauerkraut juice or live kraut brine to fruit mash.
   - Let ferment another 24 hours until gently fizzy/tangy.

3. **Strain:**
   - Strain off the fruit, pressing for maximum juice extraction.
   - Reserve pulp for secondary extraction if desired (add more sugar and repeat for extra juice).

4. **Mix Must:**
   - Combine strained juice with honey and water in a clean fermenter.
   - Top up to desired volume (4–5L). Aim for OG that’ll finish at ~18% ABV.
   - Stir well to dissolve honey.

5. **Pitch Yeast:**
   - When must is cooled to room temp, pitch hydrated K1-V1116 yeast.
   - Ferment with airlock, at 18–24°C if possible.

6. **Ferment:**
   - Allow to ferment until dry (2–4 weeks).
   - Optional: Feed with more honey or sugar if gravity drops too fast.

7. **Finish:**
   - Once clear and fermentation is complete, add a pinch of salt to taste.
   - Bottle or chill.

8. **Serve:**
   - Pour over crushed ice in shot glasses or mugs.
   - Muddle with fresh mint or basil for a true “julep” vibe.
   - Optional: Garnish with citrus peel.

## Notes
- Adjust honey/sugar for sweetness and strength.
- For more acidity, add extra citrus juice or zest.
- Make it wild, make it yours—druivenheks style!
