## Method

### 1. Prep the Base
- Preheat oven to 190Â°C (375Â°F).
- If using rice: cook and let cool slightly.
- If using noodles: boil until al dente, drain, and set aside.
- In a large skillet, melt 30 g butter or schmaltz over medium heat.
- SautÃ© scallions and peas for 2â€“3 minutes until softened.
- Add chopped kimchi and cook for 2 more minutes to deepen the flavor.
- In a large bowl, mix the rice/noodles, sautÃ©ed mixture, tuna, and haring.

### 2. Make the Sauce
- In a saucepan, melt 30 g butter over medium heat.
- Whisk in the flour to form a roux. Cook for 2 minutes, stirring constantly.
- Slowly add the milk, whisking until smooth and thickened (~5â€“6 minutes).
- Stir in mustard and yuzu marmalade (or vinegar).
- Season with salt and white pepper to taste.

### 3. Assemble the Casserole
- Pour the sauce over the tuna-rice-kimchi mixture.
- Fold gently to combine without breaking up the tuna too much.
- Transfer to a buttered baking dish (approx. 25 Ã— 20 cm or similar).

### 4. Prepare the Topping
- Melt duck fat or butter in a skillet.
- Add breadcrumbs and toast until golden and crisp.
- Stir in chopped capers and extra kimchi.

### 5. Bake
- Sprinkle the topping evenly over the casserole.
- Bake for 20â€“25 minutes until bubbling and golden.

### 6. Serve
- Let rest 5 minutes before serving.
- Garnish with extra scallions or a side of cold kimchi.
- Pairs beautifully with a bitter green salad and a glass of PJ Ciderâ„¢.

## Notes
- For extra heat: add 1 tsp gochujang or sambal to the sauce.
- For extra richness: stir a spoonful of crÃ¨me fraÃ®che into the sauce before baking.
- For late-night cafÃ© service: portion into ramekins and reheat under a broiler.
