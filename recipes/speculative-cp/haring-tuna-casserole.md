## Method

### 1. Prep the Base
- Preheat oven to 190Â°C (375Â°F).
- If using rice: cook and let cool slightly.
- If using noodles: boil until al dente, drain, and set aside.
- In a large skillet, melt 30 g butter or schmaltz over medium heat.
- SautÃ© scallions and peas for 2â€“3 minutes until softened.
- Add chopped kimchi and cook for 2 more minutes to deepen the flavor.
- In a large bowl, mix the rice/noodles, sautÃ©ed mixture, tuna, and haring.

### 2. Make the Sauce
- In a saucepan, melt 30 g butter over medium heat.

- Stir in mustard and yuzu marmalade (or vinegar).
- Season with salt and white pepper to taste.

### 3. Assemble the Casserole
- Pour the sauce over the tuna-rice-kimchi mixture.

### 5. Bake
