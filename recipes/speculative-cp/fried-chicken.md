## Method

### 1. Brine the Chicken (12–24 hours ahead)
1. In a large bowl, mix buttermilk, salt, paprika, garlic powder, onion powder, black pepper, and yuzu marmalade.
2. Add the chicken thighs and stir to coat. Cover and refrigerate for 12–24 hours.

### 2. Prepare the Dredge
1. In a large, shallow bowl, combine flour, cornstarch, and all dredge seasonings.
2. Remove chicken from the brine, letting excess drip off.
3. Coat each piece in dredge, pressing firmly to create a craggy, shaggy crust.
4. Let rest on a wire rack for 10 minutes while you heat the oil.

### 3. Infuse the Oil
1. In a deep skillet or Dutch oven, pour in corn oil to a depth of 3–4 cm.
2. Heat over medium to 150–160°C.
3. Add dried sage leaves and let them sizzle gently for 2–3 minutes until fragrant.
4. Remove sage with a slotted spoon or sieve.
5. Increase oil temperature to 175°C for frying.

### 4. Pan-Fry the Chicken
1. Carefully lower chicken into the hot oil, skin-side down.
2. Fry in batches, 6–8 minutes per side, or until golden brown and cooked through (75°C internal temp).
3. Transfer to a wire rack to drain and stay crisp.

### 5. Make the Yuzu Marmalade Drizzle
1. In a small saucepan, melt butter over low heat.
2. Stir in yuzu marmalade, rice vinegar, and chili flakes (if using).
3. Simmer 1–2 minutes until glossy and slightly thickened.

### 6. Serve
- Arrange chicken on a warm platter.
- Drizzle lightly with yuzu marmalade glaze.
- Finish with flaky sea salt or a few fried sage leaves if desired.
- Pair with pickled cabbage, colcannon balls, or buttery biscuits.

## Notes
- For a brighter flavor, consider adding a splash of lemon juice or zest to the marmalade drizzle.
- Fried sage leaves from the oil can be served as garnish.
- To reuse oil: cool completely, strain through cheesecloth or fine mesh, and store in a sealed container in a cool, dark place.
