hashish
---
this is an actual process for making hashish, not edibles etc.

use a grinder with a screen, a "kief" or "pollen" catcher. the way
that i ensure that i collect a lot of kief is i switched from using
cartridges and a battery (back) to using grass. by continually grinding
and using herb, i ensure that i am separating the trichomes (kief) from
the grass which is then put into the vaporiser (in my case, a pax 2) and heated
in the oven. the oven generates "abv" ("already been vaped") which can then be
cooked into butter and made into edibles.

when you'ce collected about a half gram of kief, this can be pressed into a
pellet (depending on the size of your press). put the kief into the press, and
apply as much force as you can. the idea is to burst the trichomes.

when this is done, you will want to place the pellet in the oven and cure it at
about 240Â°F for 12 minutes on parchment paper.

i label them with the size in grams and put them in tupperware as i produce more
than i can consume.

to use the hash you can eat them (they are decarboxylated), or you can roll it
into little balls with your fingers and place it into a bowl of herb and smoke
it. they stay lit and you have to be careful when you smoke it and manage the
fire a little carefully -- don't bother with passing, just make a bowl you
intend to smoke in one go, and don't worry about a water pipe, just go with a
spoon, a tightly packed bowl so you don't pull the hash through, and keep it
burning but not lit. it's tricky but you get the hang of it.

it's hash, not weed. it's different.
