what's medicated though?
---
In general I don't cook a lot with cannabis because I find it kind of a pain to have in the kitchen; if I have something I *enjoy eating*, and it has medicine in it, it creates a situation where I can *accidentally eat too much* of the thing that has medicine in it, and that's a bad place to be. Anyone who has used cannabis recreationally (or even medicinally, I suppose) can tell you that it is no fun to be too high, even if it is harmless.

So I have deliberately created a couple recipes that I *don't actually like a whole lot* and which are *visibly different* from my other recipes so that I am clear that I am eating something which is, you know, not just a cookie or whatever.

The other reason for doing this is much of the medical cannabis (edible) products tend to contain gelatin (gummy candies) or dairy (caramels, chocolates, etc). Having something vegan in my home is comforting when I know I will want to have an edible with me.

The Alice Toklas recipe(s) I've been toying with for decades now.
