reinventing alice

Alice Toklas did not know about decarboxylation when she wrote her recipe for "hashish fudge" in 1938. It's important to heat vegetable matter (called "bud," "flower," and so on) above 250°F when it's eaten for it to be bioavailable. This troubled me and I wanted to remake the recipe, which is essentially combining vegetable matter with spices, but allow for both extraction of the THC via ethanol and for decarboxylation by cooking it.

I am still working on this recipe (note that there is no 'spice' in it as yet). I figure it is safe to call these "tokies." They are deliberately not made *too* tasty because I find when I make an edible too enticing, I eat too many of them and this presents an obvious problem.

Ingredients:
- 4T overproof rum
- 1 c **pumpkin pulp**
- 2.5 c oats
- .5 c golden raisins
- 7 g (~1/4 oz) very finely minced cured & destemmed grass
- .25 c hemp seeds
- .125 c cacao nibs
- 2T maple syrup

*WEIGH THE BOWL FIRST.*

Combine all the above in a large bowl, stir until uniform (it should resemble a granola), and let sit for a little while (~10 minutes) so the rum can steep the grass a bit.

Then, weigh it.

Calculating dosage
---
Take the percent content by mass THC of the grass you are using, and multiply that by seven (the total number of grams you used). Figure out what your preferred dosage is (say it's 25mg) and figure out how many times that goes into the total THC miligrams you have is, and you have the total number of doses available.

Take the total mass of the tokies and turn it onto a silicone pastry mat (mine is graduated per inch, cm, and half-inch), and simply break the tokie mass into appropriately-sized dose units.

Baking
---
The tokies should be baked at 350°F for 10-12 minutes on a lightly oiled cookie sheet.
