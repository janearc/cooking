bran muffins
---
when it comes to medicine, i sometimes make an exception for an ingredient based upon the fact that it is difficult to find the medicine without the ingredient. an example of this is gelatin in the capsules we get.

the dispensaries i go to seem to carry edibles which contain one of dairy or gelatin. i got around this by buying just the oil itself and cooking with it, but then they stopped carrying just the oil, and i didn't have much luck making edibles from icewater hash. so i decided to try using the "exceptions rule" and bought [clarified butter](https://www.cannabisreports.com/producer-reports/butter-brothers), which, strangely, is available at one of the dispensaries.

**this recipe is not vegan** but it could be made vegan by using coconut oil instead of butter; i'm just not sure how it would turn out.

i also want to mention that while the texture and consistency of the recipe worked out well, the taste of it was not terrific; there's something unpleasant about the combination of bran and cannabis -- two grains -- that just doesn't work. so this recipe is kind of a failure, albeit an interesting one, and is provided for informational purposes.

ingredients
---
- 1/2 cup candied figs (soak diced, dried figs in bourbon for one week, discard the boubon)
- 1.5c bran cereal
- 1.5c whole wheat flour
- 1c vanilla almond milk
- 1T baking powder
- .5t baking soda
- .5 t salt
- 1c applesauce
- .5c maple syrup
- 1/2 cup clarified butter (...cannabis butter)
- 2T molasses
- 1T chia seeds

set the applesauce aside with the chia seeds and agitate so that the seeds are able to absorb the moisture and swell up a bit. give them about ten minutes.

in a medium bowl, combine the bran and almond milk, and let them soak together.

separately, sift together the whole wheat flour, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.

in a third bowl, combine the butter, applesauce, maple syrup, and molasses.

slowly begin to fold the applesauce mixture into the bran mixture, and then fold the flour into the bran. when this is mixed, add the figs, and then spoon into a muffin pan. 400Â°F for 20 minutes for large muffins and 10-12 minutes for small muffins (muffin tin capacity varies).
