applesauce brownies
---
there are a lot of recipes for vegan brownies that use applesauce as a binder available on the internet. this is roughly derivative from those. for this recipe, i use a [circular tart dish](https://smile.amazon.com/Tart-Dish-Size-Color-Caribbean/dp/B00S5CUJUQ/) and a gram of hash oil, and i cut it into sixteen doses, which works out pretty well.

the primary issue with using brownies as an edible is that flour-based edibles take about ninety minutes to really have an effect. for this reason i do not really like this recipe. it's good for staying asleep if i have a bout of insomnia, but it is not good for *getting to sleep* which is the primary reason i make edibles.

ingredients:
- 1/2 cup butter (i use a whole stick of earth balance butter)
- 1 cup sugar (this makes the a slightly less-sweet brownie; add more sugar if you want)
- 1 T vanilla extract
- .5 c cacao powder
- .5 c cup apple sauce, unsweetened/flavoured
- .5 c minced sharffen berger dark chocolate bits
- 1.5 c flour
- .25 c dark chocolate m&ms
- flake salt to taste
- 1 gram cannabis extract

pre-heat oven to 350Â°F. line pan with parchment. use a silicone brush to coat parchment about two tablespoons of butter and the sides of the pan as well.

melt the butter in the microwave, and add cannabis extract. microwave further 5-8 seconds, stir thoroughly. combine in a large bowl with sugar, vanilla, applesauce, and cacao powder. add the flour in slowly, about 1/2 cup at a time.

add the dark chocolate bits, stir, and pour the mix into the tart pan or your baking dish. top with flake salt and the m&ms for colour and bake for 28 minutes.

the brownies will need to be kept in the fridge and you will need to let them cool before cutting them.
