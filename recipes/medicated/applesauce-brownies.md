applesauce brownies
---
there are a lot of recipes for vegan brownies that use applesauce as a binder available on the internet. this is roughly derivative from those. for this recipe, i use a [circular tart dish](https://smile.amazon.com/Tart-Dish-Size-Color-Caribbean/dp/B00S5CUJUQ/) and a gram of hash oil, and i cut it into sixteen doses, which works out pretty well.

remember with this recipe that while it is ostensibly *brownies* that it has, as *medicine*, different design requirements than a dessert. the primary issue with using brownies as an edible is that flour-based edibles take about ninety minutes to really have an effect. for this reason flour was reduced and chia added, changing the texture substantially to something more resembling a drier cookie. this has been in the aim of improving the bioavailability of the recipe (flour proving harder to digest) and to improve the length of time it keeps in the refrigerator (or to make it shelf stable).

ingredients:
- 1/2 cup coconut oil
- 1 cup raw coconut sugar
- .5 c cacao powder
- .5 c cup apple sauce, unsweetened/flavoured (this is two "single serving" cups)
- 2T chia seeds
- .5 c minced sharffen berger dark chocolate bits
- 1 c flour
- .25 c dark chocolate m&ms
- flake salt to taste
- 1 gram cannabis extract

set aside the applesauce with the chia seeds much the same way other recipes would have you make a "chia egg" -- that is, thoroughly agitate the chia into the applesauce and allow it to absorb all the moisture. this will become quite thick. periodically stir it so that all the seeds come into contact with the applesauce.

pre-heat oven to 350Â°F. line pan with parchment. use a silicone brush to coat parchment about two tablespoons of butter and the sides of the pan as well.

liquefy the coconut oil in the microwave (you might try 30-90 seconds), and add cannabis extract. microwave further 5-8 seconds, stir thoroughly. don't overdo it.

combine in a large bowl cacao and sugar, stirring until uniform. slowly add the cannabis oil, stiring until uniform. this will be a pretty slippery mixture. to this you should add the applesauce and chia, which will be pretty stiff and should resemble in consistency egg yolk. when you have gotten the batter to consistency, add flour slowly about a quarter of a cup at a time, folding it in, and add the dark chocolate bits as well.

pour this into the tart pan, and place into the oven for 28 minutes. it should come out fully cooked although letting it cool will make it (slightly) easier to slice.
