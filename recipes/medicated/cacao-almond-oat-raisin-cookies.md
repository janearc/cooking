chocolate oat cookies
---
these are adapted from a recipe at [my darling vegan](http://mydarlingvegan.com/2014/09/cacao-goji-berries-power-cookies/).

cacao powder is added to the original recipe to make them darker, richer, and bitter, and baking soda is added to counter the acidity of raw cacao powder, and slightly more baking powder is added to lift the additional material.

and also, marihuana.

ingredients
- 1 gram pure cure brand cannabis oil
- 4 T earth balance butter
- 1 cup almond butter (I use justin's, it's super thick, so I nuke it about 90 seconds; 1 cup is about half a jar)
- .25 cup maple syrup
- 1 t vanilla extract
- 2 T chia seeds
- .25 t salt
- 1 c oats
- 1.25 t baking powder
- .5 t baking soda
- .25 c raw cacao powder
- .25 c cacao nibs
- .25 c golden raisins or goji berries

in a smallish bowl, combine the baking soda, baking powder, salt, cacao powder, and oats.

in cup or very small bowl, add 6T of cold water to the chia seeds, agitate, and leave sit for ten minutes. the idea is you want all of the seeds to be able to absorb all of the water.

in a large bowl, combine the almond butter, maple syrup, and vanilla extract. nuke the butter in a ramekin or something small, and stir in the cannabis oil, then stir the butter into the large bowl and distribute evenly. once that is uniform, fold in the chia seed mixture. this should become a pretty batter-looking emulsion at this point, and you should be able to start folding in the dry ingredients from the small bowl with the oats.

when the oats are folded in, add the nibs and raisins.

the original recipe calls for cookies of 2T each. when i make cookies of 2T, I get 19-20 cookies total, so that seems like a pretty good dose (50mg dosage * 75% concentration = ~37mg per each).

press the 2T balls down into 1cm high cookies and bake at 350F for 10-11 minutes on parchment paper (there's no way this will work without it, I don't think). they do seem undercooked when they come out of the oven but they will cook a bit and firm up as they cool.

*let them cool* before attempting to pull them off the cookie pan. they are fragile. once they set, they can be put in tupperware or whichever and keep for a while.

how do they taste though?

as expected. they're slightly bitter, slightly sweet, they have crunchy bits, they're not something you want to snack on, they taste very slightly of cannabis, and they're pretty obviously an edible, rather than a cookie, which is the whole point.

they could taste better. they don't.

that said, they're not bad, and they certainly don't taste like robitussin, and they're not unpleasant.
