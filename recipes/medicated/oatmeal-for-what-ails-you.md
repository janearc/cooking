oatmeal
---
i had a tooth extracted and was on soft food and in a lot of pain. i made this and ate it with one of my edibles and it put me right to sleep and was delicious to boot. i slept well and the pain was less noticeable.

i am convinced this oatmeal would cure many things, especially when served with a cannabis edible. serves one.

ingredients:
- .5 c mccanns 6-minute oats
- 1.5 c vanilla almond milk
- .25t cinnamon
- .25t nutmeg
- 4T maple syrup
- 4T earth balance butter
- flake salt to taste
- .25c golden raisins
- .25c dried cranberries
- 4T bourbon

boil the almond milk, add the oats, reduce to low heat. add the butter and maple syrup. it will take about ten minutes for the oats to open up and cook. stir frequently so nothing burns, adding the cinnamon and nutmeg. at the ten minute mark, add the fruit so they can cook. depending how much of the bourbon you'd like to remain in the bowl, you may either serve it with the bourbon, stirring it in as you serve it, or you may pour it into the saucepan as you're cooking it so that the alcohol cooks off. i chose to pour it into the saucepan and stir it quickly and then serve immediately. it was noticeable but not overpowering (it's less than 5% by volume). you may also add more butter if you like your oatmeal richer.
