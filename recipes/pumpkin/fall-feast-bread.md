the fall feast bread
---
Doe, Kara, and Jane set out to make pumpkin bread one day, and this was the first time Jane had made a vegan bread, and the first time they had made a vegan pumpkin anything. It turned out pretty well.

Ingredients:
- 1/4 c dried cherries
- 1/4 c dark chocolate, finely chopped
- 1.5 cups **pumpkin** as described elsewhere in this repository
- 1/3 c coconut oil
- 1/3 c vanilla almond milk
- 2 c flour
- 3 T flaxseed meal (stiffener)
- .5 tsp baking soda
- 2 tsp baking powder
- 1 tsp ginger
- 1 tsp cinnamon
- 3/4 tsp allspice
- 1/4 tsp clove (to taste)

The flour, spices, salt, flaxseed meal, baking soda, and baking powder can be combined or sifted into a large bowl.

In a smaller bowl, the wet ingredients can be combined either on low heat to ease mixture or cold with ample stirring to get to uniformity. Add this to the flour mixture in the large bowl, and make sure (as with pancakes) that there are no flour clumps), and bake in one loaf pan, greasing the inside with a light amount of coconut oil.

When the loaf is in the pan, the cherries and chocolate can be folded into the loaf from the top, lightly, to create a crust; you may consider adding either a light dusting of sea salt or a light dusting of sugar.

It should be done in about 50 minutes, or as much as 60 minutes, at 350Â°F.
