what is pumpkin spice?
---
Pumpkins are a vegetable. They do not taste like a latte, or rather, lattes do not taste much like pumpkin. Pumpkins are kind of mild and squash like. What everyone likes about pumpkin and fall is this particular spice concoction that tastes nothing like pumpkin, and is used in, among other things, pumpkin pie, and in places where fall actually happens, this is a significant event.

All jokes aside, **pumpkin spice** is:

- 1 part cinnamon
- 1 part ginger
- .75 part allspice
- .25 part clove

Now, I think most people prefer, around the time of year that people are making pumpkin spice things, to add nutmeg to their pumpkin spice. Personally, I also prefer to add bourbon in some amount to mine, if I am making something that calls for wet ingredients (lots of people don't want booze in their food, so mind that). Many recipes also suggest vanilla extract.

My suggestion is to start basic, and figure out how you like *your* pumpkin spice, and experiment. Perhaps surprisingly (and without a trace of irony I say this), pumpkin spice mixtures *resist* using sophisticated spices; it is best to use cheap, dried spice from whatever is on the shelf; don't bother trying to grate cinnamon sticks or getting expensive malabar cinnamon et cetera. Same for fresh grated ginger. It's not going to change the overall character or texture of the dish. Especially when cooking with pumpkin, the character of the dish should be the pumpkin, not the "pumpkin spice."
 
You can pumpkin-spice-ify anything. But please don't.
