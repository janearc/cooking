It's fall, even in oakland, as I am writing this, and pumpkins are appearing everywhere. Pumpkins are a squash that has a mild sweetness and are suitable for many applications in which you would put a squash or even a sweet potato and are accordingly very versatile. They can be frozen once cooked basically indefinitely and because they are a seasonal item and the plant is very prolific, by weight they are quite cheap when they are around at the grocery store. I started a long time ago buying lots of them and cooking basically as much as I could stand every year.

how to pumpkin

Depending on how and where you get your pumpkin your local retailer may have "pie-sized" pumpkins or they may have larger, "jack-o-lantern" sized pumpkins. For the purposes of cooking, it doesn't really matter. The basic idea is you are going to bisect the pumpkin, remove the seeds (setting them aside) and the squishy material (hopefully for compost) and placing the halves of the pumpkin on a cookie sheet.

The pumpkin halves should be placed on a lightly oiled (use coconut or olive oil) piece of aluminium foil and about 1/4 to 1/2" of water in the cookie sheet in the oven (that is, the pumpkins should be immersed fully). Cook at 325Â°F or so for about an hour. You will know they are done when you can press gently with a fork and leave a full impression of the fork on the outside of the pumpkin.

pumpkin seeds

Pumpkin seeds are a reasonably nutritious (containing both fat and magnesium) snack, and are worth keeping around, but can be a pain to clean. The best way is to separate the flesh from the pumpkin while preparing them for cooking. They are all attached to one big "organ" the way a cantaloupe or bell pepper are, and generally can be pulled off quickly. The "slime" or orange stuff that makes them excessively slimy and pumpkiny can be removed by rinsing them with water and then straining them through e.g., cheese cloth or a paper towel.
