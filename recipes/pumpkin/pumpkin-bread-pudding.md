pumpkin bread pudding
---
This started as my usual bread pudding recipe with a few adjustments for pumpkin and the season.

pudding
---
- 2 cups **pumpkin pulp**
- 2 whole cans whole-fat coconut milk
- 1/2 dried tart cherries
- 4 T flaxseed meal 
- 4 tsp cinnamon
- 1 tsp allspice
- 1 tsp clove
- .5 tsp nutmeg
- .5 c maple syrup
- 4 T rum

Additionally, you will need:
- 1 whole 16oz loaf sweet batard
- maraschino cherries

If you are using a stoneware pan, heat oven to 375°F, if pyrex, 335°F.

Prepare pudding the same as you would the bread pudding recipe, combining the wet ingredients in a large bowl. Whisk to an even consistency, and slowly add the cubed bread, folding it in and letting it rest to absorb the pudding.

Grease the pan lightly using coconut oil and your fingers – it should fit pretty neatly into a 9x13 pan.

Garnish with maraschino cherries. Cook for 32 minutes at 375°F, raise temperature to 400°F, and cook another 17 minutes. Allow to cool before serving. Serve with coconut sorbet (and an apertif).
