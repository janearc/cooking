baked shells
---
So I had this idea to make baked ziti but I didn't have a good meat product, and I didn't have a good cheese product. This was the first attempt at making a vegan baked pasta. It turned out okay, but I am not real happy with the meat product.

*Basically, this was a test.*

ingredients:
- field roast brand italian sausage, 1 package
- silken tofu, 1 box
- daiya mozarella shreds
- pasta shells, about 3 cups
- fresh bazil, minced, about 1 ounce, fresh
- one full jar of tomato sauce (25oz, 725g)

Cook the shells as directed (mine were 13 minutes on medium boil).

Take the sausage out of the plastic wrapping. It doesn't come out of the tube the way e.g., soyrizo does, so dice it.

Heat a 10-12" skillet on medium-high heat with 1T of coconut oil and place the tofu on it, and prepare as you would a **tofu scramble**, seasoning with thyme, rosemary, and black pepper to taste; when the tofu is sufficiently scrambled and some of the water has cooked off, add the meat. Stir frequently, and don't let the meat or the tofu burn.

When the meat has gotten around in the tofu a bit and it seems like the flavours have circulated, place all this in a 9x12 earthenware pan. Cover this with the shells. Cover the shells with the tomato sauce, and about one cup of the daiya shreds. Sprinkle the basil on top, making sure to get sauce in any hollows and to get the daiya evenly spread over the top.

Place the whole thing in the oven at 350Â°F for about 45 minutes to as long as 60 minutes, depending on how crunchy you like the top of your baked pasta.
