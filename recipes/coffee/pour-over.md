notes on pour overs
---
i've made coffee lots of different ways in lots of different coffee makers, and had lots of different people prepare coffee for me with their preferred means; part of me wishes i weren't quite so stubborn about it, but i don't think there's a better way to make coffee for yourself than a [chemex](http://www.chemexcoffeemaker.com/). i owned an espresso machine for years and was reasonably competent in using it, and i see no reason to go back.

equipment
---
- gram-accurate kitchen scale
- something to weigh coffee in
- chemex coffee maker & filters
- gooseneck kettle

basic steps
---
- wet filter with 75cc hot water
- drain water from chemex
- add coffee to filter
- add water to coffee
- remove filter at the tail
- decant coffee to a mug

managing this process carefully
---
- chemex lists a ratio of "three rounded tablespoons per five ounces of water", and this works out to approximately ten-to-one of water-to-coffee. *this is probably wrong for you*.

- chemex says to wet the filter and this does impact the taste of the coffee. it also helps to warm the chemex itself. i use about 75cc of water. the chemex has a runnel to allow pouring while there's a filter in it. the difference is not especially profound, but it is noticeable.

- measure your coffee with a scale. the "correct" ratio is anywhere from 10:1 water to coffee (10:1 is pretty strong) up to 15:1 which is much lighter and lets you experience more of the coffee's subtler notes but is also so much more dilute it loses its character. personally, i use just a little less than 13:1.

- measuring your water with a scale (1ml == 1mg) makes everything lots easier and more precise.

- this means you should probably put the whole thing on a scale and use your tare button in between steps. either use a known quantity of water when pouring into the chemex (e.g., a flask with graduations of ml), or weigh the chemex with the wet filter & coffee on the scale, and tare it and pour until the weight of the chemex increases by the amount of water you intend to pour into it. either way, you are precisely controlling the amount of water going in.

- coffee changes taste over a range of temperatures. personally i prefer my coffee to be slightly cooler than what comes out of my kettle. coffees with "brighter", "fruitier", etc notes, will do better being slightly cooler, whereas more robust coffees with darker roasts or heavy tasting notes like chocolate will do fine at hotter temperatures. personally i prefer my coffee prepared with water that is somewhat less than 208F (97C). note that by the time this goes through the chemex, it is somewhat lower.

- the vessel you drink it out of changes the way it tastes, just like with wine and bourbon. so you can drink your pour-over out of a travel thermos, and it will stay warm longer, but you will miss some of the experience of having your nose in a mug, and some of the delicate or subtle notes will be missing.

- you can "double" a recipe for coffee in a chemex, and it will come out okay; i've made 70g of coffee/900ml of water at once in an 8 cup chemex without issue, although it takes a long time to filter. this produces about 3 "diner sized mugs" full of coffee.

- as you apply water to the coffee grounds, apply mostly to the center, rather than applying down the sides of the filter. when water is applied to the sides, it tends to run directly down the cone into the coffee. 

- pour about two-thirds of the water in at first, letting the coffee bloom. slowly add water to the coffee after it begins to filter into the bottom. i try to keep the coffee and water in contact, rather than letting it all drain through at once. you can accomplish this by just using the flow from the gooseneck to "scrape" the grinds back into the water that's in the filter.

- the "tail," the last bit that comes out of the filter, is pretty bitter and just isn't anything you want in your coffee. so when you get to the point where the water is mostly filtered through the coffee and it's just kind of dribbling out, take the filter and grounds and discard it while it's still dripping. this will dramatically improve the taste of your coffee.
