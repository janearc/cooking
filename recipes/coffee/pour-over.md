notes on pour overs
---
i've made coffee lots of different ways in lots of different coffee makers, and had lots of different people prepare coffee for me with their preferred means; part of me wishes i weren't quite so stubborn about it, but i don't think there's a better way to make coffee for yourself than a [chemex](http://www.chemexcoffeemaker.com/). i owned an espresso machine for years and was reasonably competent in using it, and i see no reason to go back.

equipment
---
- gram-accurate kitchen scale
- something in which to weigh your coffee
- chemex coffee maker & filters
- gooseneck kettle

basic steps
---
- wet filter with 75cc hot water
- drain water from chemex
- add coffee to filter
- add water to coffee
- remove filter at the tail
- decant coffee to a mug

managing this process carefully
---
- chemex lists a ratio of "three rounded tablespoons per five ounces of water", and this works out to approximately ten-to-one of water-to-coffee. *this is probably wrong for you*.

- chemex says to wet the filter and this does impact the taste of the coffee. it also helps to warm the chemex itself. i use about 75cc of water. the chemex has a runnel to allow pouring while there's a filter in it. the difference is not especially profound, but it is noticeable.

- measure your coffee with a scale. the "correct" ratio is anywhere from 10:1 water to coffee (10:1 is pretty strong) up to 15:1 which is much lighter and lets you experience more of the coffee's subtler notes but is also so much more dilute it loses its character. personally, i use just a little less than 13:1.

- measuring your water with a scale (1ml == 1g) makes everything lots easier and more precise.

- this means you should probably put the whole thing on a scale and use your tare button in between steps. either use a known quantity of water when pouring into the chemex (e.g., a flask with graduations of ml), or weigh the chemex with the wet filter & coffee on the scale, and tare it and pour until the weight of the chemex increases by the amount of water you intend to pour into it. either way, you are precisely controlling the amount of water going in.

- coffee changes taste over a range of temperatures. personally i prefer my coffee to be slightly cooler than what comes out of my kettle. coffees with "brighter", "fruitier", etc notes, will do better being slightly cooler, whereas more robust coffees with darker roasts or heavy tasting notes like chocolate will do fine at hotter temperatures. personally i prefer my coffee prepared with water that is somewhat less than 204&deg;F. note that by the time this goes through the chemex, it is somewhat lower.

- the vessel you drink it out of changes the way it tastes, just like with wine and bourbon. so you can drink your pour-over out of a travel thermos, and it will stay warm longer, but you will miss some of the experience of having your nose in a mug, and some of the delicate or subtle notes will be missing. you may want to try an actual fluted teacup.

- you can "double" a recipe for coffee in a chemex, and it will come out okay; i've made 70g of coffee/900ml of water at once in an 8 cup chemex without issue, although it takes a long time to filter. this produces about 3 "diner sized mugs" full of coffee.

- as you apply water to the coffee grounds, apply mostly to the center, rather than applying down the sides of the filter. when water is applied to the sides, it tends to run directly down the cone into the coffee. 

- pour about 250cc of the water in at first, letting the coffee bloom. if the grounds are the right size, it should bubble vigorously, and you should be able to maintain this vigorous bubbling by applying water gently in a circular motion with the kettle. for me, if i start with 250cc, i stop at 450cc.

- i try to keep the coffee and water in contact. if you find that your coffee has gotten "caked" to the side, you can use the flow of the water to get the coffee back into the aperture of the chemex. be brief about this, though, as water applied to the chemex tends to run directly down the filter and into the base.

- the "tail," the last bit that comes out of the filter, is pretty bitter and just isn't anything you want in your coffee. so when you get to the point where the water is mostly filtered through the coffee and it's just kind of dribbling out, take the filter and grounds and discard it while it's still dripping. this will dramatically improve the taste of your coffee.

- i prefer my grounds to be on the coarse side; this means that water runs through them more quickly and the process of brewing happens very fast. in my experience, the coarser grounds mean i get a more robust, less-*bright* taste, leaving me with the sugary, bigger mouthfeel that I sometimes really enjoy (most of the time, in fact) in coffee, whereas the finer grounds leave me with a brighter, more acid taste that is better suited to the fruitier notes in some coffees (a geisha, a couple rwandas and some kenyas come to mind). this is to say, grind your coffee to *suit the beverage you are making*, because it makes a difference.

- grinding your coffee one batch at a time also reduces the effects of settling in a bag. this is to say, buy your coffee as beans and grind it when you use it. if you buy a bag of ground coffee, it will settle as you use it, and by the time you get to the bottom of the bag, you will be using the finest particles, making your coffee much more acidic and it will taste different than at the top of the bag. grinding the beans gives you a consistent taste. this means you also need to buy less at a time, and go through what you use, because it does eventually go "stale" sitting around.

- there seems to be a difference between the unbleached and the bleached paper filters. you wouldn't think it makes a difference, but i was running out of filters, went to buy more, and noticed there were two kinds, and bought the unbleached ones, ran water through the unbleached ones, and tasted it. they actually taste really different. they're much more mild and taste like paper or cardboard maybe without a strange overtone to it. so maybe next time you go to replace your filters, buy the brown ones. not a big deal, but worth doing.

- i realise this sounds probably impossibly fancy but i also notice the importance of the water that goes into the coffee. i have a chemex at work and a chemex at home and i use the same filters and the same coffee in the same exact amounts every day and can test small variations. ultimately what i wind up tasting is the difference between the water i have at home and the (big, expensive) filtered water system we have at work. so if you can find a way to improve the water that goes into your coffee, this will make a big difference (it's one of the primary factors that goes into a high-end whisky).
