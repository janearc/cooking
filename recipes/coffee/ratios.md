some thoughts on ratios
---
there are two ratios that you need to be keeping in mind when you are making coffee, grind-to-mass, which affects extraction, and water-to-coffee, which also affects extraction. 

## let's talk about water-to-coffee first.

for most people the ratio that you're going to use is betwen 12 and 15 to 1 although this could be as low as 10:1 and as high as 17:1. I still change this a fair amount depending on the coffee I am making and the conditions I am making it in (your environment changes the way your coffee tastes a lot), but as of the time I am writing this, I mostly settle between 14 and 15 to 1 water to coffee.

i almost always start with 25 grams of coffee, and this gives me an easy-to-remember number of 375 grams of water, and this means that it extracts into something that fits into my [mug](https://www.espressoparts.com/cafe-supplies/cups-and-porcelain/coffee-mug-black-exterior-white-interior-diner-mug) very comfortably. when i want something a little richer, i go with 30g of coffee and 420g of water. it actually extracts to right about the same volume of water, and is slightly heavier bodied. i haven't used a refractometer (yet&hellip;) to verify, but this "feels to me" like a cup that has more caffeine -- than my 25g cups.

it's important to say that these cups of coffee i make at 14-15:1 taste nearly exactly the same as coffee i was making a few months ago that i made at 12.8:1, and i made with 35g of coffee and 450g of water. i get slightly more clarity because there's more water, and i can pick out the flavours a bit more, and it's a less heavy, mouthfeel-y coffee. it also means that i have an additional cup of coffee a day (i'm having the same *amount* of coffee by weight -- just spread out over three or four cups instead of two or three).

## but this brings us to our next point, grind ratios.

i currently use a barratza encore, and it has 30 "clicks" for grind settings. the "indicated" setting for chemex is 21. when i was brewing coffee at 35g coffee to 450g water, i was grinding at 24 (looser/coarser/"less extracted").

here's how this works: when you have more water in contact with your coffee for longer, because you have more coffee and more water, you are going to have more extraction, and this can lead to your coffee having bitter and sour notes. it is also much harder to control the temperature in your brew "group" (in a chemex this is not really a real thing, but you can think of where you are brewing in the chemex as the bloom; it's very hard to control temperature there. the second you pour water in, it starts cooling off, when what you want is for it to hold its temperature, interact with the grounds briefly, and run down the cone).

so, looser grinds mean your coffee doesn't hold as much water, meaning it flows more quickly out of the filter meaning it won't over-extract and get bitter or sour so quickly, and the longer brew times required by larger doses of coffee (so if you wanted to brew 60g of coffee for example, and 900g of water, you'd open up the grind a lot, to let it through). a *really* loose grind tastes almost like iced tea when you've under-extracted; the water hasn't had enough time with your coffee. with more bulk and a looser grind, the water is "held in place" by the larger mass of coffee, allowing the extraction to take place despite the fact that the grind is looser and would ordinarily result in an under-extracted coffee.

the other thing is the tighter your grind is, proportionally more area of the bean is exposed to the water via surface area, the more rapidly it oxidises, and the more rapidly you want the water out of the brew. so you want to use less water, you want brewing to happen quickly.

looser grinds with larger masses compensate for the longer extraction time, but lean out the water and (especially with larger masses) you have to get the math right for what you are extracting *into*. use tighter grinds with smaller masses, but be more generous with the water.

## bringing this all together

the water-to-coffee ratio is most forgiving right in the middle around 15:1. if you dilute it out to 17:1 you may notice more of the subtle tastes in the coffee, but you may also wreck the coffee by making it too wet. if you like a really robust cup of coffee, you probably want to aim for 13:1, but the same thing applies; you can just as easily make an intensely bitter cup if any of the other things go wrong (if your grind is off, if your pour is off, and so on&mdash;there's just much less room for error way at the ends of the gradient).

with respect to grind, you can make "micro batches" in the chemex by going down in the grind and down in the dose. so for example, taking the grind down to 17 and the dose down to 20g, but leaving the water up at 15:1 still produces a very rich cup of coffee (although right at the limits of over extraction because the grind is so tight). you're making a cup of coffee that "feels" nearly the same as a cup of coffee made with 35g of coffee and 450g water, only you've used less coffee, (probably) gotten less caffeine, and made a smaller-by-volume drink.

what this means is that while everyone wants to talk about what the right ratio of water-to-coffee is, the real question to be asking is, "what's the ratio of water-to-bean-to-grind" because getting only two of these three right will result in Bad Coffee and getting all three right is the only way to get Great Coffee.
