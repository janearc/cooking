mason jar coffee
---
i was experimenting with cold brew and called off the experiments. here are my notes.

input was:
- 750ml water
- 160g coffee (brazil)

output was:
- ~375ml coffee

i placed the coffee and water in a slurry in the mason jar overnight, i just threw it all in there when i got home from work and took it out in the morning, giving it a good twelve hours to steep. i let it filter through the chemex with a single paper filter, letting gravity pull the coffee through. 

the resulting coffee was very tasty, had a much higher mouthfeel although i am not sure it actually had any increased viscosity; it felt full of sugars and i am certain it had a million times more caffeine. my reasons for abandoning the experiment were:
- if i use 160g of coffee, that's enough for me to make 4.5 pour-overs and i only actually netted 375ml of cold brew. best case, we can double or triple that to mayb 2-3 beverages, so i'm not even breaking even.
- the amount of caffeine in the resulting drink is assumed to be higher because of the increased steep time AND
- because it is cold and hanging out in my fridge, there is no obstacle to my just grabbing it and taking a swig meaning i am likely to develop a wicked caffeine habit if i pursue this to the point that i refine the technique
- *also*, when i did add water to the resulting coffee, it didn't actually taste very good, so it seemed unlikely to me that i would actually dilute this to begin with. so this whole recipe seems like a good way to make coffee concentrate, from which i would make e.g., baking recipes or cocktails.

if i were to refine this, i would look for a better way to pull the coffee out of the grounds. the mad scientist in me wants to use a cloth filter and siphon it out using two large vessels, but then i'd have a gallon of this stuff and i'd have to start with a pound of coffee, and down that road is nothing but tears and heartbreak. and vibrating fingers and zero sleep and you know how that goes.

and yummy coffee. etc.
