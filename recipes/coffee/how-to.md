How I Do This
--
As I talk about coffee and my interest in it, people ask me fairly frequently about how I prepare it. I want to explain how to do it, and I want to set expectations, and also clear a few things up.

First, I'm not monetising this and I want to link to a few products and people who *are* monetising their relationship with coffee, so be aware that there are people out there who are working with vendors and it's really hard to separate the ad copy and product placement from what bare information. Keep an open mind, try things, and figure out what works for you. At some point, "coffee" stops being about a drink and starts being a craft or hobby, and at that point it becomes expensive, and just buying or doing the things people are suggesting to you is inadvisable and you need to *learn* and *apply* the things you have learned as a *skill* &mdash; unfortunately there isn't a simple "buy these three things, get perfect coffee every time."

Everybody's palate is different.
Everybody's *water* is different.
Everybody's preferences are different.
Everybody's interest in coffee is different. (what is it you are coming to coffee to get out of it?)

So, with that out of the way, the equipment I personally use are (and I will try to keep this up to date):

Prep
--
I have done this enough times that I can have everything prepared in a minute or two. I keep my beans in ball mason jars at home, and I grind a week's worth at a time for work and bring it in with me in a mason jar.

The first thing I do is push the button on the electric kettle and it starts warming the water while I am doing everything else.

Then I weigh the portion of beans, grind them if necessary, and set them aside.

**How do I know how much coffee to use?** Well, for one diner-sized mug (~8-9 floz, 270ml), you might start with 25g of coffee and 375ml of water. My preference here is actually for more coffee and to go slightly stronger. There is a bit of a **grind to mass coefficient** however. This is, the more coffee you put in the filter, the more coarse it should be ground. This is because the coffee will "hold on to the water" for longer when it is finer, leading to a longer brew time, which you don't want with more coffee.

This means that when I brew coffee, I tend to brew with *more coffee*, and *coarser grounds*. Let me explain. So my grinder has settings that are listed from 1 (very fine) to 40 (very coarse). "21" is supposed to be the ideal for Chemex coffee. However, when I make coffee, I make 35g of coffee, and I grind it at 28. I sometimes make as much as 50g of coffee at once, and I need to "open up" (coarsen) the grind even further.

**How do I know how much water to use?** I heat 1.5L of water every time and use about 1.3L of it. Don't worry about how much to put in the (gooseneck) kettle, you will be weighing it. Put as much as you can comfortably heat in the (electric) kettle, you will be using that. I really like having a glass kettle, it lets me see what's going on with the water, whether it's clean, and how much is in it. **Water brings out good things in coffee** so don't be stingy. I'll discuss the ratio further down.

I gather the filter, beans, water, coffee, and within a minute or two, I have hot water. At this point, I put enough water in the gooseneck kettle to both heat it (it is a substantial conductor of heat and will bring the water temperature down), and to rinse the filter. I wet the filter using a circular motion to thoroughly wet any area that the coffee will come into contact with, and let it drain into the Chemex, and let the (electric) kettle hold temperature until I'm ready to brew.

Then when water is all drained through into the base, I leave the filter in the Chemex, and use the runnel side to gently pour the water out of the Chemex into the sink and give the gooseneck kettle another splash of hot water to warm it up, and then discard that water, giving it time to heat the actual gooseneck.

At this point, I add the coffee grounds to the Chemex, tare the scale, and we're ready to brew.

Brewing
--
I try to keep a uniform distribution of the grounds in the bottom of the filter. When I begin brewing, I give the kettle about 500ccs of hot water from the kettle, and set it to hold 203°F for the duration. In between pours, I replenish from the kettle to maintain temperature in the gooseneck kettle so that it rarely drops below about 195°F.

**The first pour** I start with enough to wet the grounds and let them aerate. Depending on your coffee, you may get very vigorous bubbling, some lazy bubbling, or just some mild settling with almost no bubbling. When I start with 35g of coffee, this is about 75-100g of water, and leaves something looking a little like a brownie in the bottom and it's liable to "collapse" when you begin the second pour.

**Timing** One of the ways I time this is I watch in the base for the stream of coffee pouring from the tip of the filter and I try to not let it stop "running" and start "dripping." This is something you have to sort of get the hang of, but if you can keep it in the "running" zone, you can have the entire thing brewed in just a few minutes, and it kind of moves effortlessly &mdash; it's like a sort of coffee "flow."

**The second pour** When the grounds are good and inundated and the water has started to deplete a little, I start a second pour. As mentioned above, I add more hot water, and if I am feeling especially fussy or I want to *really know what this coffee is about*, I will dump the entire contents of the gooseneck kettle and start with fresh hot water, getting it back up to ~ 200°F from wherever it was. The second pour usually stops around 250g, and again this is done gently and letting the brownie rise up if it's there and collapse down into the middle, using the stream from the gooseneck to "stir" the bloom as I go along. The bouyancy of the water coming up from the center/bottom should cause the coffee to collapse from the crust on top of the bloom down into the middle, and your pouring in concentric circles from the top should serve to agitate the bloom. *If you have done this a lot* an advanced technique includes stirring the bloom *very* gently if there are parts of it that seem under-served by the water from the kettle. I do this, but very rarely.

Between the second and third pours, I again top off with hot water, and the third goes very much like the second.

**The third pour** for me is a little soupier and there isn't any crust from the brownie left; everything should be pretty well agitated into the bloom. There shouldn't be anything climbing up the sides except maybe boulders (large particles from the grind that are outliers) that got stuck; your coffee is very much in the water and it is now draining consistently through the bottom. This is the slowest part of the brew, and you should keep your eye on the bottom of the filter. When it starts to slow down, you're ready to top off your gooseneck. My third pour usually gets me right to about 415g of water (again, starting with 35g coffee and aiming for 450g of water).

So at this point, I definitely toss the water because it's cooled off, and I use hot water from the hot water source for the fourth pour.

**The fourth pour** is just finishing off the pour, but you need to keep your eye on it because it also contains the bitter notes in your coffee. So keep your eye on it. As the water drains out through the grounds, it will go from the "crema" you see on a press pot coffee to cloudy to clear to suddenly you will be able to see the grounds in the filter through your coffee. This will happen over about a minute maybe. As the coffee is sucked out the bottom of the grounds, you want to start pulling the filter out of the Chemex by the corners *with the coffee still in it and dripping*. Just compost the whole thing, that last two tablespoons of coffee isn't tasty, and the Earth wants your coffee anyways.

This gets me right to 450g of water, which means 350cc give or take in the cup I use, every time.

**But what ratio should I use for my coffee?** This is super complicated. Lots of people I really respect say that 15:1 is a reasonable ratio for pour over coffee. This doesn't work for me. I like 12.8:1. Chemex themselves actually list 10:1 in their instructions (although it's listed in a very weird ratio). The other thing that changes this is the amount of coffee you are making. I make 35g of coffee, and so I use a coarser ground than someone who makes 25g of coffee, and using 12.8:1 makes sense, whereas if I used the same grind that someone who was making 25g of coffee was using, my coffee would take forever to brew and come out way too strong. So the answer here is you need to find a ratio betwee 10 and 15 to one that works for you, and you need to find a way to consistently grind to that number, *and* you need to figure out a formula in your head for adjusting that ratio when things change (the water you use, the coffee you use, the amount of coffee you use, &hellip;). There isn't a great answer.

Debugging
--
There are a lot of places you can mess up a pour over. I want to first point out Chris Baca's pour over [How To](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6K_VHmYMuE0) and Sump Coffee's Chemex [How To](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-Zpt1iz1jcw). I also want to suggest that a great place to get coffee that is consistent, and consistently great coffee, is [PERC Coffee](https://perccoffee.com/shop/). Do yourself a favour and buy a couple bags of beans from a couple places and don't be afraid to just grind them and waste them, brew things and mess up. You're going to, the same way learning to make pastry is hard -- making great coffee is every bit as difficult as making anything else well in the kitchen.

- *Grind issues* When your grind is too fine your pour will take too long. It won't "run" out the bottom, but will be drippy and slow. It will also be too tart, bright, acid, or sour; this is because it is over-extracted. If your grind is too loose, it will run so quickly out of the bottom that you won't have much body in the cup. It will have an interesting "tea" like texture, and some of the higher notes in the coffee, but it will lack the heavier, mouthfeel and body notes that most people come to love about coffee.

- *Water issues* Water issues are tough to diagnose because they present as "off" notes in the coffee. Most of us aren't lucky enough to be able to prepare our coffee in multiple places, but if you are able, try to take your coffee kit somewhere else and see if your coffee tastes the same (spoiler: it won't). The difference you are tasting is your water. For myself, these notes crop up over time and I only notice when it's way too late to change my water filter. I fixed this by setting a calendar reminder to change my water filter at home.

- *Temperature issues* Not preparing your coffee at the right temperature is frankly wasting effort. There's no point in going through all the trouble of buying good coffee and complicated equipment if you are not going to maintain temperature of your brew process. Higher temperatures, to a point, result in better coffee. Nothing over 204°F is good for your coffee, and nothing under 190°F is, either &mdash; when brewing. However, when drinking your coffee, you may find that it is more pleasant at 170°F. If you want to *really know what's going on with your coffee*, you need a temperature probe. Not a thermometer, a temperature probe. Get curious. Take readings all over your coffee brewing process. Figure out what's cold, what's hot, and solve for the parts that aren't performing.

Other brewing methods
--
- *Chemex vs Hario V60* This is pretty classic, and I just don't think the V60 filter is good enough. Let me explain. The difference between a press pot and filtered coffee is profound. Sometimes you want that heavier bodied coffee, with fines in it, and you just want all that coffee up in your face. I'm not one of those people, most days. So when I compare the Chemex to the V60, the thing that immediately becomes clear from what's in my cup is the Chemex produces a cleaner cup of coffee. The reason for this is obvious &mdash; the filter is much more substantial on the Chemex. The Chemex also lets me use more coffee. Personally, I like having the Chemex on my kitchen counter, too; it's just pretty.

- *Chemex vs "machines"* There are a couple machines that offer machine-provided pour over. Including one by Chemex. I will say that I am sceptical. Furthermore, even if they provided absolutely atom-for-atom identical coffee, I would still encourage people to learn how to make their own coffee by hand. I like *making my own coffee when I wake up*. If you don't, I have to wonder why you are making pour overs to begin with. And further, I wonder why you want a machine to do it for you. I am deeply suspicious of someone who wants machine-made slow-coffee. It boggles the mind. This used to just be called "drip."

- *Chemex vs espresso* I don't think this is a fair or relevant comparison but I will address it. I like espresso. I am vegan. This means that I don't get to go to just anywhere and order espresso drinks because they have milk in them. This does not even address the other thing I have issue with, which is the fact that I like *coffee* a lot, and while I appreciate the art of milk in coffee, I feel that milk takes away from all the nuance and subtlety in finer coffees. I would never put cream in a gesha coffee, so I can't imagine why anyone would want to torture the coffee by making espresso out of it and putting milk in it (milk contains a ton of sugar and fat that utterly changes the texture of coffee). So one way to think about this might be, single origin coffees can be thought of the way we think of single malt whiskies. Generally, we don't make cocktails out of single origin whisky. Espresso drinks are like a cocktail. There is art and beauty in their preparation, just as their is in making artful, beautiful cocktails; however, when you really and truly want to *know* a coffee, make a pour over, and do it in a Chemex. I have only one other thing to add to this, which is that I enjoy coffee with (almond) milk and sugar in it, but I treat it as an entirely diferent beverage. It's sort of something I drink without thinking much about, rather than something I pause my day around, stop, and prepare and consume mindfully. Coffee and its preparation is a ritual.
