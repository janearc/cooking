## Instructions

1. **Boil the Potatoes**  
   Place the potatoes in a pot of salted water. Bring to a boil and cook until fork-tender, about 15 minutes. Drain and allow to steam dry for 1–2 minutes.

2. **Sauté the Cabbage and Scallions**  
   While the potatoes cook, heat 3 Tbsp butter or schmaltz in a skillet over medium heat. Add the shredded cabbage and scallions with a pinch of salt and pepper. Sauté until soft and lightly caramelized, 8–10 minutes.

3. **Mash and Combine**  
   Mash the potatoes with the warmed milk and an optional spoon of marmalade or mustard. Fold in the sautéed cabbage and scallions, then stir in the 100 g of grated cheddar. Season with salt and pepper to taste.

4. **Bake**  
   Preheat oven to 200°C (400°F). Butter a baking dish and spoon in the potato mixture. Level the top, then sprinkle over the 30 g of grated cheese and drizzle with the melted butter.

5. **Optional Glaze**  
   If using the marmalade glaze, brush it over the top during the last 5 minutes of baking for a shiny, citrusy finish.

6. **Cook Until Golden**  
   Bake for 20–25 minutes, or until bubbling and golden brown on top.

7. **Serve Hot**  
   Garnish with extra scallions or a grind of fresh pepper. Serve on its own, or next to fried chicken, smoked mackerel, or a poached egg.
