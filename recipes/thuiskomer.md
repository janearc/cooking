## 🔪 Instructions

1. **Toast the Baguette (Optional)**  
   Lightly brush or spray the cut side of each baguette with neutral oil or butter. Toast cut-side down in a hot pan until just golden and crisp.

2. **Prepare the Sardines**  
   In a small bowl, gently mash the sardines with lime juice or rice vinegar until they form a coarse paste. Don’t overmix—you want some texture.

3. **Assemble the Sandwiches**  
   - Spread peanut butter thinly across the bottom half of each baguette.
   - Layer the sardine mixture on top.
   - Drizzle with chili crisp (be generous—this is your spice and crunch).
   - Add pickled carrots and daikon/onions for bite and acidity.
   - Top with cilantro and Thai basil.

4. **Close and Serve**  
   Press down lightly, cut in half if desired, and serve immediately.

## 🍻 Pairing Suggestion

**GMDFB Marmalade Cider** – Effervescent, citrus-bright, and slightly funky. Pairs beautifully with the fat of the sardines and the chili crisp’s roasted heat.

## 🛠️ Notes & Variations
- Swap peanut butter for tahini or cashew butter for a twist.
- Add thin cucumber slices or jalapeño for extra crunch/heat.
- For a vegan version: replace sardines with mashed chickpeas + nori flakes + soy sauce.
