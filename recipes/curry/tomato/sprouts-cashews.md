brussels sprouts and cashews curry
---
I made this curry for myself and ate it with Doe one evening. It was not as good as I'd hoped.

browned:
- one red onion
- one large shallot
- in 2 tbsp ish of coconut oil
- liberal salt

cleaned, de-stalked, bisected, and browned separately in a skillet on high heat, tossing continually:
- brussels sprouts, 1 lb

When the sprouts were mostly cooked, I removed them from heat.

I added:
- 1lb diced tomatoes
- 2 handfuls minced cilantro
- 2tsp (ish) garam masala 
- 2 whole curry leaves
- more liberal salt
- 1 cup cashews

to the curry base, and then added the sprouts, and turned the heat up a bit, and covered. The tomatoes immediately began to reduce, and curry began to form. I let the reduction happen, but also stirred more or less continually, making sure the tomato did not burn.

Looking at my notes from the recipe afterwards, I realise that I had forgotten to include turmeric and garlic. I also did not include the habanero pepper I had purchased for the curry because it would have made it overly hot for Doe.

I intend to make this again and will update this recipe. It has potential.
