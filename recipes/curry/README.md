curry
---
So before I start, I want to say that I am a person who is not of any kind of Asian extraction and I therefore do not own curry and I want to be sensitive and say that I do not speak with any authority. I am not attempting to appropriate anyone's culture here. I am attempting to cook food for myself. If you find that this food is tasty for yourself, I am glad for you. If you find that it is offensive, please let me know, and submit a patch and I will update the recipe(s), and we can move on.

How curry works
---
Curry is basically stuff in sauce. Because of this, curry is easily made vegan. For the purposes of this repository, we will separate things into two separate kinds of curries -- that which is a coconut-based curry, and that which is more of a tomato-based curry.

Principles
---
Generally, you brown the vegetables you wish to constitute the character of the curry (this would be something like onions) in a fat (coconut oil is a good choice), and then you have something additional to add that serves as the bulk of the dish (such as bell peppers, potatoes, and so on) which you would cook on higher heat in a separate dish, and then add to the pan in which you were browning the curry base.

Once you have done this, you then add the currying emulsifier (what makes it a curry). For coconut curries, this is usually full-fat coconut milk, and for tomato-based curries, this is just lots of tomato, diced roughly (although they tend to fall apart, so they don't have to be, really).

You can change this around somewhat and add ingredients, but with these principles, you can expand or contract in many directions.

Generally, people serve this on a long-grain rice. I prefer to serve this with rice pulao, which is made with cinnamon and cardamom (but is kind of a pain).

I like my curry super spicy, but there's no requirement that curry be spicy at all. Do what makes you happy.
