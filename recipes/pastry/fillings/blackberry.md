easy blackberry filling
---
- macerate 1/4 cup blackberries.
- add zest of 1 lemon.
- add 1/2 tsp cointreau.
- remove the chunky part of the blackberries if you have picky eaters (the center of blackberries is kind of "woody"). you can do this by straining through a fork.

this can be added to anything and doubled, etc, as needed.
