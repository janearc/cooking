tofu chilaquiles
---
start with **tofu scramble** as described elsewhere in this repository.

i use one can of **amy's black bean chili** per person.

i have not had much luck making my own **salsa verde** and find that just using a store brand from the "mexican section" of the local supermaket is fine, and chilaquiles is supposed to be comfort food anyways; it's not a fancy dish.

take two ("burrito sized" by Mission brand) tortillas, fold into quarters, then cut the "ends" off (as though you cut the binding off a book), and begin to work your way in so that you have roughly 1" square strips of tortilla. place these in a skillet with coconut or grapeseed or other high-temperature oil with coarse salt and a little **cumin** (and optionally **cayenne**). let the skillet brown the tortilla squares, turning often until they are crispy like tortilla chips. turn frequently to get most of them (but not all of them) crunchy; i like a lot of texture in my food, and part of the fun of this dish is some of them will be crunchier than others.

when the tortillas seem pretty thoroughly "done," add the tofu, and continue to mix on high heat in the skillet, ensuring that the entire mixture is coated; the tofu will stick to the tortillas (this is desirable), and a kind of "nacho"-like mix will emerge.

- ladle about 2/3 of one cup of black bean chili onto each plate, adding an equivalent amount of tofu & tortillas.
- you may at this time add [shredded **daiya cheese**](http://daiyafoods.com/our-foods/shreds/cheddar/) if you prefer cheese with breakfast, but you must let it melt a little.
- top with ~30ml salsa verde
- add diced spring onions on top for colour and flavour
- sprinkle with coarse salt to taste
- serve with hot sauce
