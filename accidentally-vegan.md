accidentally vegan
---
So there are things you may encounter that are accidentally vegan. That is, things which happen to be vegan, but which are not "prepared to appeal to vegan consumers." These are nice to know about.

- oreos (I know, right?)
- shortening (this makes pie crust possible, Spectrumâ„¢ brand is made with palm oil instead of space age stuff)
- fritos (ingredients: corn, corn oil, salt)
- fig newtons
- ritz brand crackers with peanut butter sandwiches
- red vines (corn syrup, whole wheat flour, red colouring...)
