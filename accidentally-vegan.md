accidentally vegan
---
So there are things you may encounter that are accidentally vegan. That is, things which happen to be vegan, but which are not "prepared to appeal to vegan consumers." These are nice to know about.

- oreos (I know, right?)
- shortening (this makes pie crust possible, Spectrum™ brand is made with palm oil instead of space age stuff)
- fritos (ingredients: corn, corn oil, salt)
- sun chips (the plain version, anyways)
- fig newtons
- ritz brand crackers (the "butter" flavour is accomplished with vegetable oil and "natural flavourings" which are not animal based); the cheese is dairy based, but ritz with peanut butter is fine
- red vines (corn syrup, whole wheat flour, red colouring...)
- "i can't believe it's not butter" (who knew‽)
