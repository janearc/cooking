the vegan kitchen
---
"Cooking while vegan" is kind-of slightly different than cooking while
vegetarian or, certainly, cooking while omni(-vorous). I have been a
vegetarian most of my life, and I figured it would be useful to list the
things I keep in my kitchen, just generally speaking, to have on-hand when I
want to prepare food for myself.

I refer here to shelf-stable things, rather than perishable things (because I
try to buy perishable things only when I am going to cook something
specifically; many, but not all vegans feel a core tenet of veganism is
reducing wastage and personal consumption).

- coconut oil
- sesame oil (for stir-frying, for fried rice)
- olive oil: a rich, eat-with-bread kind, and a cook-with kind
- dried fruits (I keep cherries, cranberries, raisins, coconut meat, sometimes pineapple)
- tofu of various consistency (the kind you get in a box and keep on the shelf)
- amy's brand chili and black beans
- maldon sea salt
- granola (I make this, it keeps for weeks, so I consider this "shelf stable")
- vinegar: rich balsamic, and rice vinegar
- soy sauce (primarily for stir frying and fried rice)
- hemp hearts
- maple syrup
- molasses
- tellicherry pepper
- candied walnuts
- rolled oats (because I need to make granola)
- flour (whole wheat, white, almond - I've used king arthur for years)
- corn meal
- yeast (brand seems irrelevant, but use it or it goes bad)

perishables

- bagels
- avocados
- almond milk (both dark chocolate and vanilla)
- almond butter (maple for toast and vanilla for dessert and snacks)
- peanut butter
- squashes (like kabocha; see the **engastration** directory in this repository)

ingredients in the fridge
---
It's frequently a pain in the ass to find somewhere to order delivery from, or to find a place to go out to dinner with someone. Cooking, too, can be a pain. But having a bunch of things in the fridge that are pre-prepared and resist spoilage reduce the time-to-cooked for a meal meaning you can instead cook a meal for yourself or others much more quickly by virtue of having ingredients ready to go. Consider suggesting to people to simply bring a vegetable ("Hey, come over and bring 3-4 baby bok choi and we'll make dinner!"). By doing the prep ahead of time – I tend to prep the day I shop, so on weekends – I reduce a 1-2 hour meal prep to 20-30 minutes, which is less time than delivery or going out and tastes better besides.

- cubed sweet potatoes (which can be frozen more or less indefinitely)
- sliced shallots
- sliced red onion
- spring onions / scallions / green onions (these are really perishable, so I buy them about once a week and try to cook them immediately)
- Daiya shreds (cheddar usually)
- earth balance butter-alike spread
- miyoko's butter-alike spread

meat products:
- soyrizo
- beyond meat beef crumbles (freezer)
- uptons seitan (generally i like the chorizo, bacon, and italian the most and keep all the above in the fridge)

I save all the bread that I don't use that goes stale, or biscuits that don't turn out or whichever because there are lots of recipes that can use it (like stuffing, or bread pudding, or I run the bread along a zester and make bread crumbs and use that to bread mac-n-cheese and pan fry it, and so on...). It's really kind of great to be able to make stuffing out of pumpkin biscuits, and this is something that only happens accidentally if you happen to have them sitting around. So I have odds and ends of bread in labeled ziplock bags in the freezer (and recipes here for "disposing of them").

I also try to buy as locally as possible and if I encounter a farmer's market at Bart on the way home from the office, I will pick up a couple tomatoes and some onions or persimmons or whichever, and cook that nearly immediately. This way I am less worried about things going bad in the fridge because I am "waiting for produce" to appear at an opportunity, and I have a number of shelf- and fridge- stable things (tofu, meat-alike products, daiya cheese, etc) that will cover for when produce doesn't just appear spontaneously.

portable rations

Sometimes it's hard to know when you'll be able to eat because you are going
to be out for twelve hours in an area where there are going to be unknown food
prospects. For this reason I keep around:

- justin's almond butter single-serving pouches
- mama chia & other squeeze-fruit-pouch things
- avocados

Generally I keep some or all of these in my purse (yes, I often have an
avocado in my purse).
