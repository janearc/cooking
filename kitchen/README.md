the vegan kitchen
---
"Cooking while vegan" is kind-of slightly different than cooking while
vegetarian or, certainly, cooking while omni(-vorous). I have been a
vegetarian most of my life, and I figured it would be useful to list the
things I keep in my kitchen, just generally speaking, to have on-hand when I
want to prepare food for myself.

I refer here to shelf-stable things, rather than perishable things (because I
try to buy perishable things only when I am going to cook something
specifically; many, but not all vegans feel a core tenet of veganism is
reducing wastage and personal consumption).

- coconut oil
- olive oil: a rich, eat-with-bread kind, and a cook-with kind
- dried fruits (I keep cherries, cranberries, raisins, coconut meat, sometimes pineapple)
- tofu of various consistency (the kind you get in a box and keep on the shelf)
- amy's brand chili and black beans
- maldon sea salt
- granola (I make this, it keeps for weeks, so I consider this "shelf stable")
- vinegar: rich balsamic, and rice vinegar
- hemp hearts
- maple syrup
- molasses
- tellicherry pepper
- candied walnuts
- rolled oats (because I need to make granola)

perishables

- bagels
- avocados
- almond milk (both dark chocolate and vanilla)
- almond butter (maple for toast and vanilla for dessert and snacks)

portable rations

Sometimes it's hard to know when you'll be able to eat because you are going
to be out for twelve hours in an area where there are going to be unknown food
prospects. For this reason I keep around:

- justin's almond butter single-serving pouches
- mama chia & other squeeze-fruit-pouch things
- avocados

Generally I keep some or all of these in my purse (yes, I often have an
avocado in my purse).
