the vegan kitchen
---
"Cooking while vegan" is kind-of slightly different than cooking while
vegetarian or, certainly, cooking while omni(-vorous). I have been a
vegetarian most of my life, and I figured it would be useful to list the
things I keep in my kitchen, just generally speaking, to have on-hand when I
want to prepare food for myself.

I refer here to shelf-stable things, rather than perishable things (because I
try to buy perishable things only when I am going to cook something
specifically; many, but not all vegans feel a core tenet of veganism is
reducing wastage and personal consumption).

- coconut oil
- sesame oil (for stir-frying, for fried rice)
- olive oil: a rich, eat-with-bread kind, and a cook-with kind
- dried fruits (I keep cherries, cranberries, raisins, coconut meat, sometimes pineapple)
- tofu of various consistency (the kind you get in a box and keep on the shelf)
- amy's brand chili and black beans
- maldon sea salt
- granola (I make this, it keeps for weeks, so I consider this "shelf stable")
- vinegar: rich balsamic, and rice vinegar
- hemp hearts
- maple syrup
- molasses
- tellicherry pepper
- candied walnuts
- rolled oats (because I need to make granola)
- flour (whole wheat, white - I've used king arthur for years)

perishables

- bagels
- avocados
- almond milk (both dark chocolate and vanilla)
- almond butter (maple for toast and vanilla for dessert and snacks)
- peanut butter

ingredients in the fridge

It's frequently a pain in the ass to find somewhere to order delivery from, or to find a place to go out to dinner with someone. Cooking, too, can be a pain. But having a bunch of things in the fridge that are pre-prepared and resist spoilage reduce the time-to-cooked for a meal meaning you can instead cook a meal for yourself or others much more quickly by virtue of having ingredients ready to go. Consider suggesting to people to simply bring a vegetable ("Hey, come over and bring 3-4 baby bok choi and we'll make dinner!"). By doing the prep ahead of time – I tend to prep the day I shop, so on weekends – I reduce a 1-2 hour meal prep to 20-30 minutes, which is less time than delivery or going out and tastes better besides.

- cubed sweet potatoes (which can be frozen more or less indefinitely)
- sliced shallots
- sliced red onion
- soyrizo
- Daiya shreds (cheddar usually)
- earth balance butter-alike spread
- miyoko's butter-alike spread

When a loaf of bread is pretty stale I cube it and put it in a bag I use specifically for odds and ends to make bread pudding with, in the freezer.

portable rations

Sometimes it's hard to know when you'll be able to eat because you are going
to be out for twelve hours in an area where there are going to be unknown food
prospects. For this reason I keep around:

- justin's almond butter single-serving pouches
- mama chia & other squeeze-fruit-pouch things
- avocados

Generally I keep some or all of these in my purse (yes, I often have an
avocado in my purse).
